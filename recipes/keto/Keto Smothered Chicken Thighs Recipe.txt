Ingredients:
- 4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- ⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 4 ounces sliced mushrooms
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from the skillet. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Return the skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place the skillet in the preheated oven. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of drippings from the skillet. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Return the skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Return chicken and any juices back into the skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over chicken. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
