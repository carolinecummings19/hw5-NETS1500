Ingredients:
- 1 (5 pound) roasting chicken, rinsed, giblets removed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pinch dried rosemary, or to taste
- 1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch (Optional)

Directions:
- Rub chicken on all sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, and parsley.
- Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot), add olive oil, and select the Sauté function. When hot, add chicken, breast-side down. Cook until skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip chicken and brown on the other side for 5 more minutes. Carefully remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Pour in chicken stock and deglaze the pan, scraping off all the browned bits. Turn off the Sauté function.
- Place the rack insert into the pot and place chicken on the rack, breast-side up. Close and lock the lid. Select the Poultry setting and set the timer for 28 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Carefully remove chicken to a carving board to rest.
- Turn on the Sauté function and whisk cornstarch into the pot with the stock and drippings to make a gravy.
