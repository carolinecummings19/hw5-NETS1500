Ingredients:
- 4 (8 ounce) beef chuck steaks, well trimmed, at room temperature
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided, or more as needed
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 shallot, minced
- 1/2 cup beef broth

Directions:
- Pat steaks dry with a paper towel. Season generously with salt and pepper.
- Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place steaks in the hot skillet and immediately turn down the heat to medium-high. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn steaks, add 1 tablespoon butter (or more as desired) and thyme sprigs to the pan, and cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, depending on your taste. Remove steaks from skillet and let rest, about 5 minutes.
- Meanwhile, make pan sauce: remove skillet from heat. Quickly saute the garlic and shallot for 1 to 2 minutes in the skillet using residual heat. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add beef broth. Bring to a boil and reduce for 3 minutes.
- Remove pan from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Serve sauce over steaks.
