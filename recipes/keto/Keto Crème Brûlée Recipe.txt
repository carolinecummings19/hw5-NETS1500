Ingredients:
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 5 tablespoons low-calorie natural sweetener (such as Swerve®), divided

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Whisk egg yolks and vanilla extract in a bowl until combined.
- Pour heavy whipping cream and 1 tablespoon sweetener into a saucepan; heat, whisking continuously, over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat; gradually add egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously, until well combined.
- Divide mixture evenly between 4 ramekins and place them in a glass baking dish; pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the dish.
- Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until set, about 30 minutes.
- Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sweetener over each crème brûlée. Use a culinary torch to heat sweetener until caramelized, about 30 seconds. Refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes.
