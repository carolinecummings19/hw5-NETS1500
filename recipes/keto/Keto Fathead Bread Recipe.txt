Ingredients:
- ¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 ounces cream cheese
- 1 large egg
- ⅓ cup almond flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Place mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, 20 seconds at a time, until melted.
- Whisk egg in a bowl until beaten. Mix in almond flour, baking powder, and garlic powder until well combined. Work mozzarella mixture into the dough until sticky. Stir in Cheddar cheese.
- Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and fold plastic wrap over the dough. Gently work the dough into a ball. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
- Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Cut dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Cut each ball in half to form a top and bottom bun. Place dough, cut-side down, on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set up, 10 to 12 minutes.
