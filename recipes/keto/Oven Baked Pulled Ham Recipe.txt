Ingredients:
- 1 (6 to 8 pound) bone-in ham (not spiral sliced)
- 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard
- 2 teaspoons liquid smoke
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar barbecue rub
- 1 cup sweet and spicy barbecue sauce
- 1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Stir mustard and liquid smoke together in a small bowl. Rub mustard mixture evenly over ham and sprinkle barbecue rub all over. Place ham in a large disposable pan or large deep pan lined with foil. Cover with foil.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours.
- Remove pan from oven. Increase oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Stir barbecue sauce and apricot preserves together in a bowl; pour mixture over ham and spread evenly. Cover with foil.
- Bake until a meat thermometer or instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of ham reads 205 degrees F (96 degrees C), 5 to 6 hours. Let stand until ham is cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. Shred ham with 2 forks and toss with pan drippings. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
