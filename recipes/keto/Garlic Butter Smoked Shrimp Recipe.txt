Ingredients:
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- ½ cup butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
- 3 thin strips lemon peel
- 5 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
- Place shrimp in a resealable plastic bag. Sprinkle with Cajun seasoning and drizzle with olive oil; toss shrimp around in the bag to evenly distribute seasoning. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
- Preheat a smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Add wood chips according to manufacturer's instructions.
- Place butter in a microwave-safe dish and cook on high until completely melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir in lemon peel, garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper.
- Arrange shrimp in even rows in an 8x10-inch aluminum pan. Place thyme sprigs between each row. Drizzle butter mixture over shrimp.
- Place in the preheated smoker and cook shrimp until firm and orange-pink in color, about 30 minutes. Try not to overcook as the shrimp will become rubbery. Serve immediately.
