Ingredients:
- 5 chicken leg quarters, raw skin only
- vegetable oil for frying
- salt to taste

Directions:
- Place chicken skins in a large stockpot. Cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, scrape off excess fat and cut skin into 1/2-inch wide strips.
- Place skin on a baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8 hours.
- Heat oil in a large stockpot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lower a handful of skins carefully into the hot oil. Fry until crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken skin.
