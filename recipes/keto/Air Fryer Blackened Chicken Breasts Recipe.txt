Ingredients:
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
- Mix paprika, thyme, cumin, cayenne, onion powder, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl; transfer to a large plate.
- Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Rub oil over each chicken breast until fully coated, then press into spice mixture until all sides are coated. Let sit for 5 minutes while the air fryer preheats. Place into the air fryer basket.
- Air-fry chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
- Transfer chicken to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Soup Loving Nicole
