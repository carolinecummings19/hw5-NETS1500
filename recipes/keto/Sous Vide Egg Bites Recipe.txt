Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs
- ½ cup cottage cheese
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 (4-ounce) mason jars
- 1 serving cooking spray

Directions:
- Fill a large pot with water and place a sous vide immersion cooker into the water. Set temperature to 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.
- Combine eggs, cottage cheese, heavy cream, and salt in a blender; mix until thoroughly blended, 15 to 20 seconds.
- Spray mason jars with cooking spray. Divide egg mixture between each jar. Screw on the lids until just barely tightened. Do not over-tighten as the jars can burst in the hot water.
- Submerge mason jars into the water bath and set timer for 55 minutes. When timer is up, remove jars to a cooling rack. If serving immediately, run a knife along the outer edge and invert onto a plate; you can also eat directly from the jar. Let any remaining jars cool, then refrigerate for up to 1 week.
