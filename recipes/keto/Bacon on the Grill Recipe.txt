Ingredients:
- 1 pound lean thick-cut bacon

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat.
- Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a cooling rack on top. Place bacon on rack, making sure no pieces are overlapping.
- Place baking sheet on the grill grate, close the lid, and cook for 12 minutes or until desired doneness. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess grease.
