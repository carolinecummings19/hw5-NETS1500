Ingredients:
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 pound cooked bacon, cut into pieces
- 8 large eggs
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (12 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Cook beef, garlic, and onion powder in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often, until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
- Transfer beef to a 9x13-inch casserole pan. Add cooked bacon and stir to combine; spread in an even layer.
- Whisk eggs, cream, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Stir in 3/4 of the Cheddar cheese. Pour mixture over beef in the casserole dish, then sprinkle remaining Cheddar over top.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes.
