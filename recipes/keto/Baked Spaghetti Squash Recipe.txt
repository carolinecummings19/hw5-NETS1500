Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil. Place spaghetti squash, cut-side down, onto the baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until tender and skin can easily be pierced with a fork, 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the size.
- Remove from the oven and allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Scrape out the flesh with a fork and discard the skins.
