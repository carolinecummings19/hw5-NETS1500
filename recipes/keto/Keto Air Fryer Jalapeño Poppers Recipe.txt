Ingredients:
- 6 jalapeño peppers, halved and seeded
- 7 ½ ounces cold garden vegetable cream cheese (such as Philadelphia)
- 6 bacon strips, halved lengthwise

Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Fill each jalapeño half with cream cheese and wrap with a halved bacon strip. Tuck in bacon ends or use toothpicks to secure.
- Place jalapeño poppers inside the air fryer basket, working in batches to avoid overcrowding if necessary.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer until bacon is done to your liking, 10 to 12 minutes. Keep poppers warm in an oven on the lowest setting while air-frying the remaining poppers.
