Ingredients:
- 2 Â½ tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons dried sage
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 (5 pound) pork leg with skin
- 1 large onion
- 6 cloves garlic, halved

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 430 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- Combine olive oil, sage, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a small bowl.
- Rinse pork leg and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub seasoned olive oil all over pork leg.
- Slice onion and separate layers into rings. Place onion rings and garlic halves into the bottom of a roaster. Place pork on top of onion and garlic.
- Roast in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C) and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour 20 minutes more.
- Let pork rest for 5 minutes, then slice for serving.
