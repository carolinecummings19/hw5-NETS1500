Ingredients:
- 1 egg
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ⅓ cup almond flour
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon pepper, or more to taste
- 4 boneless pork chops, 1/2-inch thick
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- avocado oil cooking spray

Directions:
- Beat egg in a medium bowl. Mix Parmesan cheese, almond flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a second bowl.
- Season pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Dip each pork chop into egg, then into Parmesan-flour mixture to coat. Place into the air fryer basket and spritz with cooking spray.
- Cook in the air fryer at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip pork chops, spritz with cooking spray, and cook until pork is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
