Ingredients:
- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg, beaten
- ¼ cup Italian-seasoned gluten-free bread crumbs
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 leaves fresh basil leaves, rolled and finely sliced
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Place broccoli florets into a food processor and pulse until broccoli is riced. Transfer to a clean paper towel and squeeze out as much water as possible.
- Place broccoli "rice", mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, bread crumbs, garlic, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes into a large bowl and mix until well combined. Separate into 4 equal golf ball-sized balls. Shape carefully into 4 individual-sized crusts. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the bottom is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Flip crusts and continue to bake until the other side is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes more.
