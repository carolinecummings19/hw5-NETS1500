Ingredients:
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 ¼ teaspoons quick-rise yeast
- 1 ¾ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons xanthan gum
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 large egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour, or as needed
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup powdered sugar
- ½ tablespoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 dash salt

Directions:
- Make dough: Combine sugar and yeast in a small bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl.
- Place milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high, stirring every 15 seconds, until 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 46 degrees C), about 45 seconds. Whisk into yeast mixture and set aside to proof, about 5 minutes.
- Combine proofed yeast with olive oil, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix for a few seconds, then slowly add flour mixture. Mix with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until dough thickens and loses some of its stickiness, about 1 1/2 minutes.
- Cover a work surface with plastic wrap and a light layer of flour. Place dough in the center, dust with a little more flour, and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap. Roll out to a 10x13-inch rectangle; remove the top layer of plastic wrap.
- Make filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle brown sugar mixture evenly over top.
- Starting at a long edge, roll dough up like a jelly roll, using the plastic wrap to help lift and roll as you go. Lightly sprinkle dough with more flour and cut into 10 pieces with a sharp knife. Place rolls in a greased baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm spot to rise for 15 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Bake rolls in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 22 to 27 minutes.
- Make frosting: Beat butter and cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar; mix until smooth. Mix in lemon juice, vanilla extract, and salt.
- Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and immediately drizzle frosting over top.
