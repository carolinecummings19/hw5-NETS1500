Ingredients:
- 6 eggs
- 2 ¾ cups almond milk
- ½ cup coconut flour
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- cooking spray

Directions:
- Whisk eggs and almond milk together in a bowl until well combined.
- Combine coconut flour and salt in a separate bowl. Stir in egg mixture; whisk until a smooth and soft batter is formed. Let stand for 5 minutes.
- Heat a 6-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet with cooking spray. Pour in 1/4 cup of the batter and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook covered until the top of the wrap is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen wrap; flip wrap and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.
