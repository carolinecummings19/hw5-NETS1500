Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 ¼ cups warm water (about 110 degrees F/43 degrees C)
- 1 ⅓ cups rice flour
- ⅔ cup sorghum flour
- ½ cup potato starch
- ½ cup cornstarch
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3 eggs
- 1 tablespoon xanthan gum
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt

Directions:
- Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Combine yeast mixture, rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, cornstarch, vegetable oil, eggs, xanthan gum, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared loaf pan; smooth top of dough with the back of a wet spoon.
- Place dough in a warm place until it rises just over the top of the pan, about 1 hour.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Bake in the preheated oven until medium golden brown, about 25 minutes.
