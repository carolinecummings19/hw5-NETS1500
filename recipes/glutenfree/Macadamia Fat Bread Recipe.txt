Ingredients:
- 1 cup coconut butter
- 1 cup chopped macadamia nuts
- 5 eggs, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon stevia sugar substitute (such as Truvia®)
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2 ½ tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
- Place coconut butter and macadamia nuts in a food processor and process on high to achieve a part-butter, part-chunky nut meal. Reduce speed to medium-low and add 1 egg. Run processor to combine, about 10 seconds. Add remaining eggs, one at a time, blending until mixture is creamy.
- Turn off the food processor and add stevia, baking soda, and salt; process to combine, 10 to 15 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and process until mixture is evenly blended. Pour in lemon juice and reduce speed to low; blend well. Scrape the sides of the bowl again and mix once more to thoroughly combine.
- Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool before transferring to a wire rack.
