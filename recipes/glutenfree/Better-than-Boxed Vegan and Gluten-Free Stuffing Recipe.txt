Ingredients:
- 16 ounces vegan, gluten-free bread, cubed
- ½ cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®)
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ¼ teaspoon dried marjoram
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- aluminum foil

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes out onto 2 baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until bread cubes are dry and lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
- Melt vegan butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add celery and onion and saute until vegetables are softened but celery still has a bit of snap, about 5 minutes. Season with parsley, sage, thyme, garlic powder, salt, pepper, rosemary, and marjoram. Cook and stir for 1 more minute. Stir in vegetable stock and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. After it reaches a boil, remove from heat.
- Pour stock, vegetable, and herb mixture over bread cubes in the mixing bowl. Stir gently until well combined. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and let sit for 5 minutes. Remove foil, fluff stuffing with a fork, and serve.
