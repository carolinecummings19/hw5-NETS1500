Ingredients:
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- ⅔ cup chickpea flour (besan)
- 4 tablespoons water, or as needed
- cooking spray

Directions:
- Mix red onion, yellow onion, salt, jalapeno, garlic, coriander, chili powder, turmeric, and cumin in a large bowl. Stir until evenly combined. Add chickpea flour and water. Stir to combine into a thick batter. Add more water if necessary. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes.
- Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon 2 tablespoons of batter into the basket and flatten. Repeat as many times as your basket allows without the bhajis touching.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Mist the tops of each bhaji with cooking spray. Flip and cook 6 additional minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
