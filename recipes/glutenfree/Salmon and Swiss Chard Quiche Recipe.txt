Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ bunch Swiss chard, chopped
- 1 ½ cups sliced button mushrooms
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 2 tablespoons smoked salmon
- 3 large eggs
- 1 ½ cups low-fat milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- chopped fresh chives for garnish (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add Swiss chard, mushrooms, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
- Spread chard mixture on bottom of prepared pie plate. Break salmon into pieces and arrange evenly over chard. Whisk together eggs, milk, salt, nutmeg, and pepper in a bowl. Pour over salmon.
- Bake until a knife inserted in center comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Cool about 10 minutes before cutting into wedges. Top with chives (if using).
