Ingredients:
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), undrained
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 210 degrees F (100 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Drain chickpeas, reserving 1/2 cup liquid from the can; save chickpeas for another use. Pour chickpea liquid into a large bowl and add cream of tartar. Beat with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until glossy peaks form, about 20 minutes. Stir in vanilla.
- Spoon mixture into a piping bag. Pipe into small circles, about 1 inch in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until meringues are firm and separate easily from the parchment paper, about 90 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely, at least 15 minutes.
