Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups creamy peanut butter
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- 2 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
- Beat peanut butter, butter, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until creamy. Gradually mix in confectioners' sugar until incorporated; mixture will be stiff.
- Shape into balls and place onto a wax paper-covered baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, 30 to 60 minutes.
- Place chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
- Press a toothpick into a peanut butter ball; dip into melted chocolate, coating all but a small area at the top. Return to the baking sheet and remove the toothpick, then press on the surface to hide the toothpick mark. Repeat to dip remaining balls. Refrigerate again until chocolate is firm, at least 30 minutes.
