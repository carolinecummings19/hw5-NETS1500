Ingredients:

- 8 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled

- Gather all ingredients. Grant Webster / Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman / Prop Stylist: Gabe Greco
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry two tortillas at a time in the hot skillet until firm, but not crisp, about 30 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels. Grant Webster / Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman / Prop Stylist: Gabe Greco
- Reduce the heat to medium, and add more oil to the skillet if dry. Crack in eggs and cook until the outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the whites are completely set, about 4 minutes. Grant Webster / Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman / Prop Stylist: Gabe Greco
- While the eggs are cooking, combine refried beans and butter in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high in 1-minute intervals until hot. Grant Webster / Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman / Prop Stylist: Gabe Greco
- Place tortillas onto plates and spread with a layer of hot refried beans. Grant Webster / Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman / Prop Stylist: Gabe Greco
