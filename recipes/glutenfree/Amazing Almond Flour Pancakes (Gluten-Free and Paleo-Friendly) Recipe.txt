Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1 tablespoon chocolate chips (such as Enjoy Life®), or more to taste (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste (Optional)
- 1 egg
- 1 egg white
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ cup water, or as needed

Directions:
- Preheat a lightly oiled griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Whisk almond flour, chocolate chips, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk egg, egg white, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture, adding enough water to reach a pancake batter consistency.
- Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the prepared griddle and cook until pancakes are golden brown and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
