- Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined.
- Whisk egg, vegetable oil, and vanilla together in a second bowl until well combined. Gradually stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients with a wooden spoon until incorporated; batter should still be still lumpy. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Add milk and mix until batter is smooth. Let sit until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if batter is too thick. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Spray a griddle with cooking spray and preheat over medium-low heat.
- Working in batches, drop 1 to 2 heaping tablespoonfuls onto the preheated griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
