Ingredients:
- 2 ¾ cups gluten-free flour blend
- ¼ cup buckwheat flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 ½ teaspoons xanthan gum
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons agave nectar
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle gluten-free beer, at room temperature
- 2 ¼ teaspoons rapid-rise yeast
- 2 tablespoons milk, or to taste (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds, or to taste (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Mix flour blend, buckwheat flour, sugar, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl.
- Beat eggs, vegetable oil, agave, and apple cider vinegar in another large bowl with an electric mixer. Mix in dry ingredients and beat until smooth. Stir in beer and yeast, then mix on high speed for 4 minutes. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
- Brush the top of the loaf with milk and sprinkle poppy seeds evenly over the surface. Cover oiled waxed paper and let rise until doubled in volume, 30 to 60 minutes.
- Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle and the internal temperature of the loaf reaches 210 degrees F (99 degrees C), 35 to 45 minutes.
