Ingredients:
- ¼ cup coconut flour
- 1 scoop gluten-free protein powder (such as GNC Pro Performance® Isolate)
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup 2% milk, or more to taste
- ¼ cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- ¼ cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste
- olive oil cooking spray
- 1 large banana
- 1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste

Directions:
- Combine coconut flour and protein powder in a bowl. Whisk in eggs. Add milk, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly until incorporated; batter should not be too thick or too runny. Sprinkle coconut flakes and chocolate chips into batter; mix well.
- Grease a large skillet with olive oil spray and place over medium-high heat.
- Cut banana into 24 slices. Place all slices into the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip banana slices, add a drop of honey onto each one, and cook until caramelized, about 3 more minutes. Transfer banana slices to a plate.
- Using 1/2 of the pancake batter, spoon four equal circles into the skillet. Press 3 banana slices into each circle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat to make remaining pancakes.
