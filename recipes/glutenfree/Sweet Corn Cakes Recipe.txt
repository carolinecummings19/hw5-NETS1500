Ingredients:
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ⅓ cup masa harina
- ¼ cup water
- 1 ½ cups frozen corn kernels, thawed
- ¼ cup cornmeal
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- In a medium bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in the masa harina and water until well combined.
- Put the corn in a blender or food processor and coarsely chop on low speed. Stir the corn and the cornmeal into the butter mixture. In another bowl, mix together the sugar, cream, salt and baking powder. Combine the two mixtures until well blended. Pour the batter into an ungreased 8x8 pan.
- Cover the pan with foil and place into a 9x13 inch pan filled 3/4 inch high with hot water. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the cake comes out clean. Remove small pan from water and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
