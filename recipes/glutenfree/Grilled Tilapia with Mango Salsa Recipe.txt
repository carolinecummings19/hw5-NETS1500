Ingredients:
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets
- 1 large ripe mango, peeled, pitted and diced
- ½ red bell pepper, diced
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 tablespoons minced red onion
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- Prepare the fish: Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, garlic, basil, black pepper, and salt in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add tilapia fillets, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
- Meanwhile, make the salsa: Combine mango, bell pepper, jalapeño pepper, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl. Add lime and lemon juices and toss well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Remove tilapia from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Grill fillets until fish is no longer translucent in the center and flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets.
- Serve tilapia topped with mango salsa.
