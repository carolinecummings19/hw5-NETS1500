Ingredients:
- 1 cup diced zucchini
- ½ cup canola oil
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup white rice flour
- ½ cup sweet rice flour
- ½ cup cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons tapioca starch
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon xanthan gum
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Combine zucchini, oil, eggs, and vanilla in a blender; pulse until mixture resembles a milkshake.
- Whisk sugar, rice flours, cornstarch, tapioca starch, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in zucchini mixture until batter is well blended; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
- While the bread is cooling, make the glaze: Mix confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a small bowl to form a thin glaze. Drizzle over the cooled loaf.
