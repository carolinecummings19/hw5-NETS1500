Ingredients:
- 2 pounds Yukon gold or red potato, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
- Combine potatoes, broth, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 1 minute. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
- Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Carefully transfer potatoes to a deep 8-inch square baking dish.
- Combine 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, cream, garlic powder, pepper, and nutmeg in the pressure cooker with the remaining liquid; select Sauté function and cook until smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes.
- Pour sauce evenly over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.
- Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes.
