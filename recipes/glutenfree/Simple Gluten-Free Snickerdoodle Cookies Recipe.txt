Ingredients:
- 1 ⅓ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup butter at room temperature
- 1 cup sugar, divided
- 1 egg
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
- Whisk butter and 3/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a separate bowl until soft and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add egg; whisk until well combined. Add flour mixture gradually; whisk on low speed until a soft dough is formed, about 2 minutes. Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls.
- Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar with cinnamon in a bowl. Roll balls in cinnamon mixture and place on the prepared baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
