Ingredients:
- 1 cup white sugar, divided
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 3 large egg whites
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 pint fresh strawberries

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; draw a 9-inch circle in the center of the paper.
- Whisk 1/4 cup sugar and cornstarch together in a small bowl.
- Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar, continuing to beat until sugar is completely dissolved and stiff peaks form. Gently fold in cornstarch mixture and lemon juice.
- Spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of meringue onto the prepared baking sheet to fill the circle. Pipe or spoon remaining meringue to form a taller edge around the circle to create a shallow bowl, making decorative swirls if desired.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off. Let meringue sit in the oven for 30 minutes; do not open the door. After 30 minutes, remove meringue from the oven; it should be hard on the outside and slightly moist on the inside.
- Beat cream and confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Spread onto meringue base and arrange strawberries over top.
