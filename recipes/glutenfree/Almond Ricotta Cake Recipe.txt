Ingredients:
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 large lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated, divided
- 2 cups blanched almond flour
- 9 ounces ricotta cheese
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup sliced almonds, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch springform pan and line with parchment paper.
- Bean 3/4 cup sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla sugar; mix until well combined. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold in almond flour and ricotta cheese with a silicone spatula.
- Wash and dry the beaters. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold stiff egg whites into almond-ricotta batter; pour into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with sliced almonds.
- Bake on the center rake of the preheated oven until edges of the cake are lightly browned, about 50 minutes. Cake will still be a little wobbly in the middle.
- Remove from the oven and let cake cool completely in the pan before transferring to a cake platter, about 1 hour. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
