Ingredients:
- 1 very ripe banana, mashed
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons ground flax seed (Optional)
- Â¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil

Directions:
- Mix together mashed banana and beaten eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add ground flax seed and vanilla; mix until batter is well combined.
- Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the skillet and cook until the centers start to bubble, about 30 seconds. Flip pancakes and continue cooking until the bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
