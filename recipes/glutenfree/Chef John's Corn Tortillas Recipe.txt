Ingredients:
- 1 cup masa harina, or as needed
- ¾ cup hot tap water, about 130 degrees F (55 degrees C)
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
- Add masa harina to a large bowl; add water and salt. Stir with your fingers until dough starts to pull together.
- Knead for a few minutes until smooth and texture resembles modeling clay or putty. Add more water if dough is too dry and more flour if too wet.
- Place a damp towel over dough to keep it from drying out. Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Cut a resealable plastic bag into 2 rounds the same size as your tortilla press; set aside. Place a clean kitchen towel over a pie dish for cooked tortillas; set aside
- Place 1 plastic round on bottom of the tortilla press. Pull off a little piece of dough, enough to roll into a 1 1/2-inch, about 1-ounce ball. Place dough ball in center of plastic round and press down lightly; cover dough with remaining plastic round.
- Fold tortilla press over, applying pressure to lever arm until tortilla flattens to desired thickness.
- Open tortilla press; peel off top plastic round. Align your index finger on edge of bottom plastic round at edge of tortilla; flip it over into your other hand using your index finger. Carefully peel off plastic.
- Gently slide tortilla, with your palm up, into a hot, dry skillet over medium- to medium-high heat. Cook 1 side for 30 to 45 seconds; flip and cook other side for 1 minute. Flip and press once or twice with a spatula until tortilla puffs up slightly; cook for 30 seconds. Flip and cook 5 to 10 seconds.
- Quickly transfer tortilla to the prepared pie dish; fold towel over to keep warm. Repeat pressing and cooking with the remaining dough, stacking and wrapping tortillas.
- Leave tortilla stack wrapped until soft and supple, at least 15 minutes.
