Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups almond flour
- 1 tablespoon gluten-free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 2 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 ounces cream cheese, cubed
- 2 eggs

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Mix almond flour, baking powder, and garlic salt together in a bowl.
- Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 1 minute; remove and stir. Microwave for 1 minute more; remove and stir until well incorporated. Stir flour mixture and eggs into the melted cheese mixture, working quickly. Knead by hand until a sticky dough forms. Keep kneading and squeezing until dough is completely uniform, about 2 minutes.
- Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Roll each into a long log, then press ends together in a bagel shape and place on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until bagels are golden, 10 to 14 minutes.
