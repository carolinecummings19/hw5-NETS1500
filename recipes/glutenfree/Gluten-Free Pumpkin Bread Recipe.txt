Ingredients:
- 1 cup pumpkin purée
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 eggs, beaten

- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ cup raisins

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Combine pumpkin purée, sugar, eggs, oil, and applesauce in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl; stir into pumpkin mixture until just blended into a batter. Gently fold in raisins; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
