- Gather all ingredients. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Mix rosemary, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; rub onto chops, coating both sides. Place chops onto a plate, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chops in the hot skillet until no longer pink in the center, about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Add shallots to the skillet; cook and stir until just browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour vinegar into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth; cook and stir until sauce has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Remove sauce from the heat and stir in butter until melted. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Serve over chops. Enjoy! Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
