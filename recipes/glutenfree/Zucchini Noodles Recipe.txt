Ingredients:
- 6 zucchini
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced (Optional)
- salt and black pepper to taste
- Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Cut zucchini into thin, noodle-like strips (a spiralizer or mandoline works well for this). Toss with 2 teaspoons salt, and place in a colander to drain for 30 minutes.
- Bring a pot of water to boil. Add zucchini; cook for one minute. Drain; rinse immediately with cold water to stop cooking.
- Heat butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add zucchini and garlic; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. KGora
