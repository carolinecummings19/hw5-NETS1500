Ingredients:
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup honey
- 2 large eggs, slightly beaten
- 2 cups rice flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 2 teaspoons hemp seeds

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
- Beat butter and honey in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs a little at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add rice flour, baking powder, and cardamom to butter mixture; mix until just combined. Roll dough into small balls, about 1 heaping teaspoon each.
- Pour hemp seeds into a small bowl. Press the top half of each dough ball into seeds. Transfer dough balls, seed-side up, to the baking sheet and gently press to 1/4-inch thickness.
- Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes.
