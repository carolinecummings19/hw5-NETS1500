Ingredients:
- 1 ½ pounds potatoes
- 1 egg at room temperature, lightly beaten
- ⅓ cup potato starch
- 1 tablespoon sweet rice flour
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- 2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prick each potato a few times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.
- Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
- Peel potatoes and pass through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in egg; mix well.
- Whisk potato starch, sweet rice flour, and salt together in a bowl. Sprinkle over potato mixture; stir until a soft dough has formed. Cut dough into 4 equal parts with a knife or pastry cutter.
- Dust the work surface with rice flour to keep dough from sticking. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into 1-inch gnocchi. Gently roll each one with the back of a fork to create ridges. Repeat with remaining dough.
- Shake off any excess rice flour and let gnocchi rest, about 5 minutes.
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi in batches and cook, without stirring, until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.
