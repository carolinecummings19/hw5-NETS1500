Ingredients:
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and halved
- 1 pound cod fillets, cubed
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon grated onion
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 3 tablespoons oil for frying

Directions:
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add cod and continue to cook until cod and potatoes are both soft, about 5 more minutes.
- Drain well and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add egg, butter, onion, and parsley; mash until well combined, then form into four patties.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels before serving.
