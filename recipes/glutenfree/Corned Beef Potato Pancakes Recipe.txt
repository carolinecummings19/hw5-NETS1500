Ingredients:
- ½ (12 ounce) can corned beef, broken into very small chunks
- 3 medium potatoes, shredded
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1 large egg
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup vegetable oil

Directions:
- Place corned beef into a large bowl with potatoes, green onions, and egg; season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into golf ball-sized balls.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place potato balls, a few at a time, into the hot skillet. Flatten balls with a spatula and fry until crisp and golden brown, about 7 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat to cook remaining pancakes.
