Ingredients:
- 21 ounces cauliflower, cut into florets with 1-inch stalks
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
- 1 ½ ounces bacon, chopped
- ⅓ cup diced onion
- ⅓ cup diced carrots
- ⅓ cup chopped celery
- 7 ½ ounces chicken breast, cubed
- ⅓ cup frozen peas
- 2 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 ½ tablespoons water

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Place cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice. Transfer to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool completely, about 10 minutes.
- Transfer cauliflower rice to a cheesecloth and squeeze out as much water as possible to ensure it crisps during the cooking process. Spread cauliflower onto the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Stir and continue baking for about 7 minutes more.
- Remove cauliflower from the oven; stir to mix and dry as it cools.
- Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Place cooled cauliflower rice into a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, beaten egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper and mix until completely combined. Press mixture into the bottom and around the edges of an 8-inch round, nonstick pan to form a crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook bacon in the hot skillet until crisp and the fat has rendered. Add onion, carrots, and celery; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add peas and mushrooms; cook until mushrooms have softened and peas are heated through, about 5 minutes.
- Pour in chicken broth and cream. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper; stir well. Reduce heat and simmer at a low boil until sauce is reduced by one-fourth, about 5 minutes. Mix together cornstarch and water in a small bowl to create a paste. Add slowly to chicken mixture in the skillet, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens.
- Remove crust from the oven. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
- Pour chicken mixture into baked cauliflower crust. Top with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.
- Cook pot pie under the preheated broiler until browned and bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool before serving, about 5 minutes.
