Ingredients:
- 2 cups gluten-free pancake mix
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅔ cup milk
- 3/4 teaspoon almond extract, divided
- ¼ cup raspberry jam
- ⅔ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine pancake mix, butter, and sugar in a bowl; stir until crumbly. Stir in 2/3 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract until fully incorporated; the dough will be sticky.
- Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet, spaced about 2 inches apart. Make a shallow indentation in center of each dough ball using the back of a teaspoon. Fill each center with 1 teaspoon jam.
- Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool.
- Combine confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons milk, vanilla extract, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon almond extract; mix until smooth. Drizzle glaze over Danish.
