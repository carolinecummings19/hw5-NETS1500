Ingredients:
- 2 cups blanched almond flour
- ⅓ cup butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons powdered erythritol sweetener
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 ¼ cups powdered erythritol sweetener
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with aluminum foil if worried about leakage.
- Stir almond flour, butter, erythritol, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl until well combined; the mixture will be crumbly. Press into the prepared pan bottom.
- Bake on the center rack in the preheated oven until just golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and powdered sweetener together using an electric stand or hand mixer at low speed until fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add lemon juice, vanilla extract, and lemon zest; beat until well combined.
- Bake on the center rack in the preheated oven until almost set and slightly jiggly in the center, 45 to 55 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan. Keep in the pan, cover, and refrigerate to fully set, at least 4 hours to overnight. Run a knife gently around the sides, unclamp, and carefully remove the pan; it should come right off.
