Ingredients:
- 1 cup very warm water
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 2 teaspoons yeast
- 2 cups gluten-free flour blend
- ½ cup rice flour
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
- 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
- Whisk water and sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in yeast. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine gluten-free flour, rice flour, Italian seasoning, xanthan gum, gelatin, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whisk vinegar and olive oil into yeast mixture; pour over flour mixture. Mix on high speed until a wet, sticky dough forms, about 6 minutes.
- Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Lay another sheet of parchment paper on top; smooth out dough to fill the baking sheet. Let dough rest, about 10 minutes.
- Bake in the preheated oven until dough puffs up, 5 to 10 minutes. Peel parchment paper off the top. Continue baking until dough is golden brown and edges are cooked through, about 20 minutes.
