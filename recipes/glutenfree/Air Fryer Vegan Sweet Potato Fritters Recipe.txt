Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Combine shredded sweet potato, almond flour, onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, and turmeric in a bowl; stir until well combined. Scoop into 9 balls using a large cookie scoop and form into patties. Place patties into the air fryer basket making sure they are not touching. Spray tops with cooking spray.
