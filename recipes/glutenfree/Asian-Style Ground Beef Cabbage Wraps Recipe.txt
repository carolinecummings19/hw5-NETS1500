Ingredients:
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 cup diced fresh mushrooms
- ½ cup diced onion
- 3 tablespoons coconut aminos (soy-free seasoning sauce)
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 8 leaves cabbage
- ½ cup matchstick-cut carrots
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- 8 sprigs cilantro, or to taste (Optional)
- 1 pinch sesame seeds (Optional)
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)

Directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground beef in the hot skillet, breaking up any large clumps, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until vegetables soften, about 4 minutes.
- Add coconut aminos, Sriracha sauce, ginger, garlic, and vinegar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper.
- Evenly divide mixture among 8 cabbage leaves; sprinkle carrots and onions on top. Sprinkle green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes on top. Roll each cabbage leaf over and around filling to form a packet.
