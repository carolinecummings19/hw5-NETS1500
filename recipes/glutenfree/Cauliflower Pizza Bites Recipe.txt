Ingredients:
- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into large chunks
- 2 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅓ cup pizza sauce

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with parchment paper squares.
- Grate cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl using a fine grater. Chop any remaining pieces too small to grate and add to the bowl.
- Cook in the microwave until cauliflower is soft and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour into a clean dish towel and let cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes.
- Wrap the towel around cauliflower and squeeze out as much liquid as possible; the drier, the better.
- Combine squeezed cauliflower, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl until well combined. Scoop evenly into the prepared muffin cups. Pat down cauliflower mixture with the back of a spoon, making it compact.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and spoon pizza sauce evenly onto each crust. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese.
- Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let pizza bites sit in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove parchment paper from the bottoms and arrange bites on a platter.
