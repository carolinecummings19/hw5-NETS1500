Ingredients:
- 3 cups blanched almond flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup nonfat Greek yogurt
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, divided
- 1 tablespoon blanched almond flour

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners.
- Sift 3 cups almond flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together into a bowl; set aside.
- Beat sugar, melted butter, Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in flour mixture until well combined, being careful not to overmix.
- Toss ¾ cup chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon almond flour together in a bowl until chips are lightly coated; fold into batter. Spoon batter into the prepared cups, filling each to the top. Sprinkle remaining ¼ cup chocolate chips over muffin tops.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.
- Cool muffins in the tin on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.
