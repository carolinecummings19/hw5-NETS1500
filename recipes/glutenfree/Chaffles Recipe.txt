Ingredients:
- 1 large egg
- Â½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
- Preheat a waffle maker.
- Whisk egg in a small bowl; stir in mozzarella cheese until batter is well combined.
- Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the preheated waffle maker, spreading it out from the center with a spoon. Close the waffle maker and cook until steaming stops and chaffle is well browned, about 3 minutes. Don't overcook, as that will make it chewy. Repeat with remaining batter.
