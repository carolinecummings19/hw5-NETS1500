Ingredients:
- 2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon xanthan gum
- 4 eggs
- 1 ½ cups milk
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons softened butter, or more as needed for cooking

Directions:
- Combine flour, salt, and xanthan gum in a large bowl; form a well in the center. Whisk eggs and milk together in a separate bowl and pour into the well; mix until slightly combined. Add melted butter and mix until a soft batter is formed, 1 to 2 minutes. Cover and let stand for 45 minutes.
- Heat a lightly buttered 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crêpe; flip crêpe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.
