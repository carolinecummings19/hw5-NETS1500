Ingredients:
- 1 cup white sugar, or to taste
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- ⅓ cup cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt (Optional)
- 3 cups unsweetened almond milk
- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)

- Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt together in a saucepan off the stove. Add 1/4 cup almond milk; whisk until smooth and foamy. Continue adding almond milk, 1/4 cup at a time, whisking after each addition.
- Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a simmer and starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.
