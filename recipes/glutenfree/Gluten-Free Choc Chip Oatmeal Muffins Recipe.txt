Ingredients:
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- 1 cup applesauce
- 1 cup rolled oats, or more to taste
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
- Beat together brown sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and beat until well combined.
