Ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon coconut oil
- 2 cups frozen chopped rhubarb
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed (Optional)
- 1 cup raspberries
- 1 packet stevia powder, or to taste (Optional)
- 2 cups water, or as needed (Optional)
- ¾ cup small tapioca pearls
- ⅔ cup coconut milk
- 2 dates, pitted and chopped
- 1 tablespoon maca powder (such as Organic Burst)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 packet stevia powder, or to taste (Optional)

Directions:
- Make sauce: Grease a medium saucepan with coconut oil and place over medium heat; add rhubarb. Cook until rhubarb starts to soften, adding water if needed, about 10 minutes. Stir raspberries and 1 packet stevia powder into rhubarb; cook until sauce is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Make porridge: Fill a large pot halfway with water and bring to a boil; add tapioca. Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until tapioca is completely translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.
- Meanwhile, blend coconut milk, dates, maca powder, and vanilla in a blender until smooth.
- Strain tapioca porridge through a fine-mesh strainer and return to the pot over low heat. Stir coconut milk mixture and 1 packet stevia powder into porridge. Simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more.
- Pour porridge into 3 wine glasses and top with raspberry-rhubarb sauce.
