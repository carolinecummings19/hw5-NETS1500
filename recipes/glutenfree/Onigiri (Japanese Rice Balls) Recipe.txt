Ingredients:
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- salt
- 1 sheet nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1-inch strips, or as desired (Optional)

Directions:
- Combine 2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cool rice until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
- Fill a small bowl with water. Place 2 tablespoons of salt in another small bowl.
- Dip hands in water and rub salt over hands. Take a handful of warm rice and form it into a ball; gently squish with your hands into an "L" or "C" shape, then apply gentle pressure to the sides to shape it into a triangle.
- Wrap a strip of nori around the triangle, using a bit of water to help it stick if necessary.
