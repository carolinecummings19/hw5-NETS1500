- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon zest, divided
- 1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®) (Optional)

Directions:
- Place lemon juice in a small bowl and sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over it. Let stand for about 15 minutes until gelatin softens.
- Combine heavy cream, sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest in a saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer. Whisk in gelatin mixture until dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in orange liqueur.
- Strain the cream mixture into a medium bowl and divide evenly among small glass bowls or ramekins.
