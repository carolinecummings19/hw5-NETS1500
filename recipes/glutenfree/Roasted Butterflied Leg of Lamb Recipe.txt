Ingredients:
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 (8-pound) leg of lamb, boned and butterflied to an even thickness, most fat removed
- 1 lemon, juiced
- ½ cup minced fresh parsley, cilantro, or mint

Directions:
- Mix oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano; spread paste on both sides of the lamb and let stand for an hour until meat comes to room temperature.
- Adjust oven rack to upper or upper-middle position (depending on lamb's thickness) and preheat broiler on high for at least 10 minutes.
- Place lamb, cut-side up, on a large wire rack set over a foil-lined roasting pan. Broil, moving pan so entire surface browns evenly, about 8 minutes. Turn lamb over; continue to broil until well browned on the other side, about 8 minutes longer. Turn off broiler, remove lamb from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the lamb; roast in the preheated oven for a total of 50 minutes to 1 hour, until thermometer registers a rosy-pink 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Check lamb several times after 30 minutes.
- As soon as lamb comes out of the oven, squeeze on lemon juice and sprinkle with fresh herbs. Carve, slicing across the grain when possible. Arrange on a platter, drizzle with accumulated juices, and serve.
