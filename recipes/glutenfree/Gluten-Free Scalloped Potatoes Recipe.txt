Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 5 medium Idaho potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
- ½ cup grated reduced-sodium Parmesan cheese (Optional)
- 1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
- Line a large microwave- and oven-safe casserole dish with parchment.
- Place butter in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on high until melted, 30 to 45 seconds. Whisk in cornstarch and cayenne pepper to form a paste. Add milk and whisk until well blended. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir, and microwave until thick, another 2 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese.
- Place 1/2 of the potatoes in the prepared casserole dish and spread 1/2 of the sauce over top. Repeat with remaining potatoes and sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and paprika over top.
- Microwave, covered, on high for 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Transfer potatoes to the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until sauce is bubbly and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
