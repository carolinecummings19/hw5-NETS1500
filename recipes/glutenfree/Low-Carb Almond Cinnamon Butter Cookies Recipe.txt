Ingredients:
- 2 cups blanched almond flour
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as Swerve®)
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon sugar-free vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Mix almond flour, butter, sweetener, egg, vanilla, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined. Roll dough into twelve 1-inch balls. Place balls onto the prepared baking sheet. Press down twice with a fork onto each ball to make a crisscross.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. AngieWard76
