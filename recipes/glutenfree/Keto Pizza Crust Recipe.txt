Ingredients:
- 1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)
- 1 ½ teaspoons paprika
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
- Place cauliflower florets into a food processor and blend into rice-like bits. Transfer to a saucepan and add water. Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer cauliflower rice to a bowl and refrigerate until completely cooled, about 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Spread cooled cauliflower rice onto a clean kitchen towel. Wrap it up tightly and squeeze out all the water. Transfer to a large bowl and add eggs, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, paprika, oregano, and salt. Mix well.
- Transfer cauliflower mixture to the baking sheet and spread and shape it into a pizza crust shape.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely before carefully flipping crust over and adding toppings, if desired.
