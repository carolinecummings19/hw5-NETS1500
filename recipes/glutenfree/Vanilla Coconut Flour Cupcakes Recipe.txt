Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs, cracked into a bowl and whisked to combine
- ⅔ cup sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons gluten-free vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ½ cup King Arthur Coconut Flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place an oven rack in the center position. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with 10 paper liners; grease the liners for guaranteed crumble-free cupcakes.
- Beat together eggs, sugar, oil, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl. Add milk; whisk until smooth. Sift together coconut flour and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to egg mixture; stir to combine. Divide batter among the prepared liners, filling each 3/4 full.
- Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes,
- Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn them out onto a wired rack to cool completely. Frost cooled cupcakes with your favorite frosting.
