- 1 cup white cornmeal
- 1 cup gluten-free baking flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup 2% milk
- ⅓ cup low-salt butter, melted

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 8x13-inch glass dish.
- Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add milk, melted butter, and egg; whisk until well combined. Pour batter into the glass dish.
