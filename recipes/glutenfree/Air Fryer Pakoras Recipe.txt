Ingredients:
- 2 cups chopped cauliflower
- 1 ¼ cups chickpea flour (besan)
- 1 cup diced yellow potatoes
- ¾ cup water
- ½ red onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- cooking spray

Directions:
- Mix together cauliflower, chickpea flour, potatoes, water, red onion, salt, garlic, curry powder, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a large bowl until well combined. Set batter aside to rest for 10 minutes.
- Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray.
- Spoon 2 tablespoons batter into the prepared basket and flatten. Repeat this as many times as the basket space allows without the pakoras touching. Mist the top of each pakora with cooking spray.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Flip and cook for 8 more minutes. Transfer pakoras to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining batter.
