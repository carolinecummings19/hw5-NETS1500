Ingredients:
- 2 ¼ cups King Arthur Almond Flour
- 2 tablespoons King Arthur Coconut Flour
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Get out a large rimmed baking sheet.
- Whisk together almond flour, coconut flour, Italian herbs, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.
- Whisk eggs and oil together in a separate bowl until frothy. Pour egg mixture into the dry ingredients and mix together to form a dough. Shape dough into a ball.
- Transfer dough to a piece of parchment paper and top with a second sheet of parchment paper. Roll dough between the two sheets to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
- Remove and discard the top sheet of parchment paper. Slide the crust and the bottom sheet of parchment paper onto a large rimmed baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have started to crisp and the crust has started to brown all over, 15 to 20 minutes.
- Remove partially baked crust from the oven and top with desired toppings. See below for further cooking and serving instructions.
