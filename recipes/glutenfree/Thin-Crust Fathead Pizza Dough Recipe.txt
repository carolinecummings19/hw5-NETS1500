Ingredients:
- 2 teaspoons yeast
- 2 tablespoons warm water
- 1 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 cup blanched almond flour
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Dissolve yeast in warm water in a bowl. Set aside for about 5 minutes.
- Place mozzarella cheese into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 90 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds until cheese is completely melted. Stir in yeast mixture and egg and stir to combine; mixture will not incorporate well at this point.
- Stir in almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt. If mixture is difficult to mix, reheat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften the cheese. Stir again until well incorporated. Using your hands, knead the dough for 2 minutes.
- Place dough on baking sheet and press with your fingers into a thin crust, approximately 11-12 inches in diameter.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, top with your favorite pizza toppings, and return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
