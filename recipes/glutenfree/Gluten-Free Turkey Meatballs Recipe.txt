Ingredients:
- ¾ pound ground turkey
- ½ pound chicken sausage, casings removed
- ⅔ cup gluten-free bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine ground turkey, chicken sausage, bread crumbs, basil, milk, garlic, Parmesan cheese, beaten egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; mix gently with a fork. Form mixture into 1 ¼-inch diameter balls and place on prepared baking sheet.
