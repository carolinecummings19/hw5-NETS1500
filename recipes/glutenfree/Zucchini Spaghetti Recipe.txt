Ingredients:
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon salt, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground thyme
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 3 zucchini, cut into long strands

Directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and black pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
- Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, salt, basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and red pepper flakes into ground beef; cook and stir until sauce is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste.
- Mix zucchini "noodles" into sauce, pressing down to fully submerge them; simmer over medium-low heat until zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes.
