Ingredients:
- ¾ cup sweet manioc starch (polvilho doce) (such as Yoki®)
- ¾ cup sour manioc starch (polvilho azedo) (such as Yoki®)
- ¼ cup whole milk
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- ¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Mix sweet manioc and sour manioc starches together in a bowl until fully combined.
- Combine milk, water, olive oil, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add starches. Stir until liquid is absorbed; mixture will be very dry. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool just until safe to handle.
- Add eggs to starch mixture in the saucepan; mix until smooth and dough pulls away from the sides. Add Cheddar cheese and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese; mix well.
- Using gloved or lightly oiled hands, pinch off a golfball-sized piece of dough, roll into a ball, and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining dough. Line the air fryer with a piece of parchment paper. Place balls into the basket in batches, approximately 1 inch apart.
- Bake in the air fryer until browned outside, 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining balls.
