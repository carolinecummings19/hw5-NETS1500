Ingredients:
- 2 cups pitted Medjool dates, roughly chopped
- 2 cups raw cashews
- 1 cup raw or roasted unsalted almonds
- ¾ cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder (such as Guittard Cocoa Rouge)
- ½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- 1 tablespoon cold espresso, or more as needed (or water)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
- Place dates, cashews, almonds, cocoa powder, shredded coconut, coconut oil, cold espresso, vanilla, salt, and cayenne in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off to start, then process for about 1 minute. Check to ensure mixture is sticky and moist enough to come together. Add more coffee if needed. Continue to process until mixture becomes a chunky mass.
- Line a baking pan with plastic wrap. Scoop mixture into pan. Press down with a spatula until mixture is even. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface and smooth again with your hands. Refrigerate until cold and firm, 2 to 3 hours.
- Remove from the pan and unwrap. Cut into 12 bars. Unknown
