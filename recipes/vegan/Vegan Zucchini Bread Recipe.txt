Ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons flax seeds (Optional)
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon arrowroot powder (Optional)
- 1 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups shredded zucchini

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
- Whisk flour, flax seeds, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and arrowroot together in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside.
- Whisk applesauce, white sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth; fold in flour mixture and shredded zucchini until moistened. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans.
