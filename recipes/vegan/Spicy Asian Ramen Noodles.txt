Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 Â½ tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
- 2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles
- 2 tablespoons chopped peanuts
- 2 medium green onions, thinly sliced diagonally

Directions:
- Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl. Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside.
- Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.
- Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency. Your hot noodles will soak up the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.
