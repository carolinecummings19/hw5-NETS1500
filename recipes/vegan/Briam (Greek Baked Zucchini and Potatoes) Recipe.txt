- Spread potatoes, zucchini, and red onions in an extra-large baking dish (9x13-inch or larger, or 2 baking dishes). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cover with puréed tomatoes, olive oil, and parsley; season liberally with sea salt and pepper. Toss until vegetables are evenly coated. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir gently, then continue baking until vegetables are tender and moisture has evaporated, about 30 minutes more. Recipe Tip Add up to 1/4 cup of water if the vegetables are too dry after the first hour of baking. Don't add too much liquid, however, as there should be no water left at the end of baking.
