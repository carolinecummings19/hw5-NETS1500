Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond milk
- ⅓ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
- 6 tablespoons water
- 3 tablespoons dry egg replacer (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 3 cups unbleached or all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®), melted
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons water
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
- Combine almond milk and margarine for dough in a large microwave-safe bowl; microwave on high power for 1 1/2 minutes.
- Combine water and egg replacer in a bowl; mix well. Let sit for 1 minute to thicken.
- Meanwhile, add sugar and yeast to the warm milk mixture and stir to combine. Mix in egg substitute. Add 3 cups flour and salt; mix with your hands until well combined. Add more flour (up to 1 cup) and knead until dough is no longer sticky. Cover bowl with a towel and let rest in a warm place for 1 hour.
- Punch down dough and roll on a lightly floured surface into a 12x16-inch rectangle.
- Spread melted margarine over the dough and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon; smooth filling ingredients with a spoon. Starting at the long edge, roll dough into a log and cut into 12 rolls. (For bigger rolls, roll from the short edge.) Place rolls in a greased pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
- Remove rolls from the refrigerator, uncover, and allow to warm for 30 to 60 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
- When rolls are almost finished, mix confectioners' sugar, water, and vanilla for glaze in a bowl. Spread on warm rolls.
