Ingredients:
- 3 cups water
- ⅓ cup flax seeds
- 1 cup soy milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ cups brown sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups chopped rhubarb
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®), cut into cubes
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
- Bring water and flax seeds to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain mixture to remove seeds. Allow to cool to lukewarm.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
- Mix soy milk and lemon juice together in a small bowl. Set aside until curdled, about 5 minutes.
- Combine flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
- Blend brown sugar and oil in a separate bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup flax egg mixture, curdled soy milk, and vanilla extract. Stir sugar mixture and rhubarb into the flour mixture until flour is just incorporated.
- Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. Mix brown sugar, vegan margarine, and cinnamon together to make streusel topping. Spoon a little streusel topping over each muffin.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
