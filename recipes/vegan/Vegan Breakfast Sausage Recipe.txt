Ingredients:
- 1 cup texturized vegetable protein (TVP)
- 1 cup warm vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- ¾ cup quick-cooking oats
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
- 2 teaspoons dried sage
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground thyme
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil

Directions:
- Mix TVP, vegetable broth, and flaxseed meal together in a large mixing bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Add oats, yeast, flour, gluten, sage, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic powder, thyme, smoked paprika, salt, and cayenne. Mix until well blended.
- Combine water, soy sauce, and maple syrup in a separate container and mix well. Add to the TVP mixture and combine into a slightly crumbly dough. Mix well to activate gluten and let dough sit for 5 minutes; dough should stiffen slightly and become less crumbly.
- Form into tablespoon-size balls and flatten slightly.
- Heat oil in a cast iron or nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Cook sausage patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side.
