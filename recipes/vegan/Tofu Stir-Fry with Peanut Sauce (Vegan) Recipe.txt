Ingredients:
- 1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
- ¼ cup peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground chili pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 carrots, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 (14 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
- 4 cups baby spinach
- 1 ½ cups cooked brown rice

Directions:
- Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, Sriracha sauce, and ground chili pepper together in a bowl until a smooth sauce forms.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and bell pepper; sauté until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu and sauté until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
- Pour sauce into the skillet and stir to coat tofu and vegetables. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then stir in spinach, 1 cup at a time, until wilted. Serve over brown rice.
