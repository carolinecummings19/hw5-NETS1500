Ingredients:
- 1 cup Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original Almondmilk or Almond Breeze Extra Creamy Almondmilk
- 1 cup raw slivered almonds
- 2 tablespoons white miso paste
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 10 ounces shell pasta
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 cups Brussels sprouts, halved
- 2 tablespoons white wine (or water)
- 2 scallions, sliced
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon hemp seeds
- 1/3 teaspoon sea salt
- extra-virgin olive oil to taste, for drizzling
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs (chives, tarragon, or parsley)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees c) and brush a 7x9 baking dish with olive oil.
- Make the White Miso Sauce: In a high-speed blender, puree the cashews, miso paste, garlic, Dijon mustard, water, lemon juice, olive oil, and salt until smooth.
- Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the pasta according to the instructions on the package, cooking until al dente. Drain and toss with a little olive oil so that it doesn’t get clumpy.
- Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add Brussels sprouts and cook, stirring occasionally until browned and beginning to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat, pour in white wine (or water). Stir to scrape up any bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pan.
- Add pasta, scallions, and white miso sauce. Stir to coat, then transfer to the baking dish. Top with panko bread crumbs, hemp seeds, a few pinches of salt, and drizzle the top with olive oil.
- Bake, covered, until the Brussels sprouts are fully tender and the dish is warmed through, about 15 minutes.
- Remove from the oven, top with fresh herbs and serve. Cook's Note: If you’re not vegan, top with 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese. Bake uncovered until bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
