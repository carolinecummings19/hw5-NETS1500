Ingredients:
- 1 ½ pounds fresh cranberries
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 2 teaspoons grated orange zest
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cinnamon stick

Directions:
- Combine cranberries, sugar, orange juice, orange zest, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Add cinnamon stick and select Saute function; cook until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard cinnamon stick.
- Blend sauce with an immersion blender for a smoother consistency. Let cool; sauce will continue to thicken naturally.
