Ingredients:

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 inches of salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high and simmer, undisturbed, until tender but still firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain potatoes and place back in the pot to dry and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- As soon as potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel potatoes by rubbing skins off with your hands. Pass peeled potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl (alternatively, mash until very smooth.) Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Fold in flour, egg, and salt until flour is incorporated and dough starts to hold together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead once or twice until mostly smooth (do not overwork). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Divide dough into 4 even portions. Roll and shape each portions of the dough into long "snakes," about ¾-inch in diameter. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cut snakes into about 1/2-inch long pieces. (Optional: Roll each piece against the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board to make light ridges.) Transfer shaped gnocchi to a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet dusted with flour. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high. Working in batches, drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; transfer cooked gnocchi with a spider or slotted spoon to desired sauce. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Serve and enjoy! Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
