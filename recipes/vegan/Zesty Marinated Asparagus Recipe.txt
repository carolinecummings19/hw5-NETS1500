Ingredients:
- 2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2½ inch pieces
- 1 ½ cups balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch asparagus just until tender, about 1 minute. Plunge into a bowl of cold water to cool. Drain asparagus and place in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in vinaigrette and seal bag. Refrigerate at least 3 hours, turning bag occasionally.
- Just before serving, drain asparagus, reserving vinaigrette. Arrange on a serving platter and sprinkle with lemon zest, parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve reserved vinaigrette in a small dish on the side.
