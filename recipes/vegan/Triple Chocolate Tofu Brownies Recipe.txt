Ingredients:
- ¾ cup whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ½ (12 ounce) package silken tofu, drained
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- ½ cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
- Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
- Place tofu in a blender; cover. Blend until smooth. Add sugar and olive oil; blend for 1 minute. Pour into a mixing bowl; stir in vanilla extract.
- Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching until chocolate is melted. Stir melted chocolate into tofu mixture until combined. Stir in flour mixture until thoroughly combined, about 3 minutes. Fold in chocolate chips; transfer to the prepared pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool before slicing into bars.
