Ingredients:
- 2 heads broccoli, separated into florets
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Toss broccoli florets with extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and garlic in a large bowl. Spread the broccoli out in an even layer on a baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until florets are tender enough to pierce the stems with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and transfer to a serving platter.
- Squeeze lemon juice liberally over broccoli before serving for a refreshing, tangy finish. jewels
