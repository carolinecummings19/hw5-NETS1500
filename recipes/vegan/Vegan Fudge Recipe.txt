Ingredients:
- 1 (10 ounce) package vegan semisweet chocolate chips (such as Nestle® Toll House Simply Delicious)

- ¼ cup coconut oil

Directions:
- Grease an 8-inch square glass baking dish with coconut oil.
- Combine chocolate chips, sweetened condensed coconut milk, and 1/4 cup coconut oil in a saucepan. Let sit over low heat, stirring only as needed until chips are melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
