Ingredients:
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Heat oil in a cast iron skillet until shimmering. Carefully place Brussels sprouts, cut-sides down, into hot oil. Sprinkle in garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until Brussels sprouts begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
- Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven; cook until Brussels sprouts are very browned and tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Shake the skillet every 5 minutes to ensure even cooking.
- Season with salt and pepper, stir in balsamic vinegar, and serve immediately.
