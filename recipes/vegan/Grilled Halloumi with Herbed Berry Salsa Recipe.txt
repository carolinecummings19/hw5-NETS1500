Ingredients:
- 4 ounces fresh blueberries
- 3 ounces red currants
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, divided
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram, stems removed
- 1 habanero pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons agave syrup
- 2 limes, divided
- Â½ cup cashews
- 8 ounces halloumi cheese, cut into 8 slices

Directions:
- Place blueberries and red currants into a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons mint, 2 tablespoons cilantro, marjoram, habanero, olive oil, agave syrup, and juice of 1 lime. Mix and set aside.
- Heat a nonstick griddle over medium-high heat. Cook cashews until browned, stirring often to keep from burning, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cashews to a plate and set aside. Reduce heat to medium and brown halloumi cheese slices, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
