Ingredients:
- vegetable oil, for frying
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Â¾ cup water, or as needed

Directions:
- Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil should be at least 1-inch deep.
- Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add water, a little at a time, until a ball forms and the dough doesn't stick to your hands, about 5 minutes; you may not use the full amount.
- Tear off plum-sized pieces of dough and flatten into 1/2-inch disks.
- Fry pieces of dough in hot oil until brown on both sides, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or napkins before serving.
