Ingredients:
- 8 ounces your favorite pasta
- 2 onions, sliced vertically
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons oil
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 garlic clove, sliced
- 3 sprigs thyme, leaves only
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
- Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes, or according to package directions.
- Meanwhile, add butter and oil to a deep skillet over high heat. Add onions, and cook and stir until they take on a little color. Add sugar, salt, pepper, vinegar, and water, and continue to cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until onions are very tender and dark brown, about 15 minutes.
- Turn heat down to low; add milk, garlic, thyme, and grated Parmesan. Blend the sauce until smooth with an immersion blender.
- Drain pasta, reserving a small amount of water to thin sauce if needed. Stir pasta into sauce. lutzflcat
