Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- ½ cup almond milk, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- ½ cup maple syrup
- ½ cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup rolled oats
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup coconut oil, melted and slightly cooled
- ½ cup pecan pieces, chopped

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and 1/2 of a standard muffin tin with cooking spray.
- Mix almond milk and vinegar together. Set aside until milk appears curdled, about 5 minutes.
- Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a large bowl.
- Whisk almond milk mixture, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fold in flour mixture using a rubber spatula until batter is just combined. Do not overmix.
- Fill each jumbo muffin cup with 1/2 cup batter. Fill each standard muffin cup with 1/4 cup batter.
- Mix oats, flour, cinnamon, and salt together to make streusel topping. Rub in coconut oil until large clumps form. Fold in pecans. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the streusel over the jumbo muffins. Top standard-sized muffins with 1 tablespoon streusel.
- Bake muffins in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake standard-sized muffins for 5 to 8 minutes more. Bake jumbo muffins for 10 to 15 minutes more.
- Let cool for a few minutes before removing from the tins.
