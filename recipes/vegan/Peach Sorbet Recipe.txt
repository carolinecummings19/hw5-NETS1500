Ingredients:
- 1 pound ripe peaches - peeled, pitted, and chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup white sugar

Directions:
- Blend peaches in a blender until smooth. Measure out 1 ½ cups peach purée into a medium bowl. Stir in lemon juice immediately and refrigerate.
- Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove simple syrup from heat and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
