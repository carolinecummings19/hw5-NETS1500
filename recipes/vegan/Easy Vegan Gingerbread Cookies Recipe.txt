Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup coconut oil, at room temperature
- ⅓ cup molasses
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
- Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, allspice, and salt into a bowl.
- Beat coconut oil, molasses, and sugar in a separate bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-combined; add vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture and mix to form a sticky dough, about 2 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours.
- When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Roll out dough on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut dough into desired shapes with cookie cutters, dipping the cutters into flour as needed so they don't stick to the dough; place them on the prepared baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
