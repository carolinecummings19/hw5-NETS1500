Ingredients:
- 2 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 ½ tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)
- 2 scallions, sliced
- ½ medium lime

Directions:
- Rinse potatoes in a colander to remove excess starch. Drain.
- Place potatoes into a large microwave-safe bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil and salt; toss to coat. Cover and microwave on high for 4 minutes. Stir, cover again, and microwave until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Whisk gochujang, remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in the bowl used to cook the potatoes. Return potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
- Roast in the preheated oven, stirring once or twice, until potatoes are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and garnish with scallions. Squeeze lime juice over top.
