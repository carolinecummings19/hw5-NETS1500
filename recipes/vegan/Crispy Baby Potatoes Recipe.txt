Ingredients:
- 1 ½ pounds baby potatoes, halved
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
- Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and add enough water to reach the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add potatoes, cover, and steam until fork tender, about 10 minutes.
- Transfer potatoes to a bowl. Add parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to coat.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes to hot oil and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until potatoes are browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
