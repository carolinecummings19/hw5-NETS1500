Ingredients:
- 2 cups lukewarm water (105 degrees F, 40 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ tablespoon salt
- 1 cup marinated olives (such as Star Garlic & Basil) - drained, chopped, and herbs and garlic reserved
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley, or as needed

Directions:
- Combine water and yeast in a large bowl. Add 1 cup flour and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Stir using a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in olives, reserved herbs and garlic, and garlic powder until incorporated. Add remaining flour 1 cup at a time, stirring until thoroughly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour.
- Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to an 8-inch cast iron skillet and spread to coat the bottom and sides. Flour your hands. Remove plastic wrap from the bowl, transfer dough to the prepared skillet, and shape into a disc. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoons olive oil on top of the loaf and sprinkle with salt and parsley. Score the top of loaf with a knife.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the top is nicely browned, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove bread from the oven and turn on to a wire rack to cool before serving, about 20 minutes.
