- Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead until pliable and smooth. If dough is too sticky, add more masa harina; if it begins to dry, sprinkle with water. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Preheat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
- Divide dough into 15 equal-sized balls. Using a tortilla press, a rolling pin, or your hands, press each ball flat between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cook a tortilla in the preheated pan until browned and slightly puffy, about 30 seconds. Flip tortilla over and continue cooking until the other side is browned, about 30 more seconds. Remove to a plate; cover to keep warm and moist. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
