- For Tamarind Roasted Carrots: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Trim and scrub carrots, reserving 1 cup of the carrot tops for the bean dip. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
- Toss carrots with ginger, granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt on a large rimmed baking sheet. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
- Whisk together tamarind paste, honey, coconut aminos, black pepper, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until smooth; set aside. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
- Roast carrots in the preheated oven until partially tender, about 20 minutes. Remove carrots from oven. Drizzle with about 1/4 cup of the tamarind mixture and turn to coat evenly. Return to oven and continue roasting until carrots are tender, browned, and sticky, about 5 minutes. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
- Meanwhile, for Carrot Top White Bean Dip combine white beans, carrot tops, cilantro, olive oil, mint, garlic, chile, and salt in a food processor; process until mostly smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. With processor running, gradually pour in water and continue processing until mixture is very creamy, about 1 minute. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
- Spread bean dip onto a serving platter and arrange roasted carrots on top. Drizzle with remaining tamarind mixture to taste. Garnish with chopped red onion and fresh cilantro. Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo Recipe developed by Nicole Hopper
