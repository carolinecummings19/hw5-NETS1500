- Inspect two pint-sized jars for cracks, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until needed. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bring water, vinegar, sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool for 2 minutes.
- Meanwhile, divide carrots, radish, cucumbers, and jalapeños evenly between the two clean jars. Pour hot liquid over vegetables in the jars and let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
