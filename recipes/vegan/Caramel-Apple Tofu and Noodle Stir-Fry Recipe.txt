Ingredients:
- 8 ounces linguine or fettuccine pasta
- 1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping
- 1/4 cup less-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons Asian-style chili paste (sambal oelek) (such as Huy Fong)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed
- 1 (14-to 16-ounce) package firm tofu, cubed and patted dry
- 1 small onion, cut into thin wedges
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup coarsely shredded red cabbage
- 1 carrot, cut into matchsticks
- 1 apple, cut into matchsticks
- chopped peanuts, for garnish
- fresh cilantro, for garnish
- 4 lime wedges, for serving

Directions:
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
- Meanwhile, for sauce, whisk together caramel topping, soy sauce, peanut butter, vinegar, chili paste, and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl.
- Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu, stirring frequently, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove from skillet.
- If needed, add more vegetable oil to the skillet. Cook onion and garlic, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add cabbage and carrot; cook, stirring frequently, until nearly tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
- Add tofu, sauce, and apple to skillet; cook, stirring frequently, until apple starts to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pasta; toss and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with peanuts and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
