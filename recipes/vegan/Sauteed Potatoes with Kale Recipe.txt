Ingredients:
- 2 pounds white potatoes, cubed
- Â½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 bunch kale, stemmed and torn into pieces
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender but still holding their shape, about 15 minutes. Drain.
- Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until quite hot. Toss in pieces of kale; reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring often, until kale begins to soften and crisp slightly, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic.
- Add remaining olive oil when onions are beginning to brown. Stir in potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until potatoes are completely softened, about 5 minutes. Remove lid; cook and stir until potatoes just begin to brown, about 10 minutes more.
