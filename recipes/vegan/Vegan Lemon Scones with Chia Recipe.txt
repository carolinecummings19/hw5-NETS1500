Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup oat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- ⅓ cup soy milk
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
- ¾ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, chia seeds, and white sugar in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil in until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in soy milk, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest until a dough forms.
- Transfer dough to a bowl and knead in bowl until workable, about 8 times. Gently roll into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Press into a circle about 1 inch thick; cut into 10 wedges. Place scones onto prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
