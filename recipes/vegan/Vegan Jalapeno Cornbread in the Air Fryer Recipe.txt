Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- 3 tablespoons water
- cooking spray
- 1 cup stone-ground yellow cornmeal
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced, or to taste

Directions:
- Combine water and flaxseed meal in a small bowl and set aside for 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray a 6-inch heat-proof inner pot with cooking spray.
- Combine cornmeal, flour, nutritional yeast, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Add the flaxseed and water mixture, almond milk, and oil; stir until it just comes together with no lumps. Stir in jalapeno and pour into the prepared pot; place into the air fryer.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Remove the inner pot carefully with tongs, flip the cornbread, and continue to air fry until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 5 minutes more. Serve warm.
