Ingredients:
- 2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas
- 1 tablespoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
- Drain and rinse chickpeas under cold running water. Place in a bowl, cover with cold water, and stir in baking soda. Soak for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
