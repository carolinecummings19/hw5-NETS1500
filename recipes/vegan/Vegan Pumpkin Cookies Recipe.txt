Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin purée
- 1 ⅓ cups white sugar
- ⅓ cup vanilla-flavored almond milk
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon sugar

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Mix flour, pumpkin purée, sugar, almond milk, vegetable oil, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon sugar together in a bowl until a smooth dough forms. Spoon dough, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto a baking sheet.
