Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup minced onion, divided
- 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 (15 ounce) can lentils, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
- 8 large carrots (about 1 inch in diameter), peeled
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 4 cups water, plus more as needed
- 2 cups less-sodium soy sauce
- 8 drops liquid smoke
- 8 hot dog buns, split
- 4 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)
- yellow mustard, for serving

Directions:
- Make Lentil Chili: Reserve 1/2 cup onion for serving. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1/2 cup onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute.
- Add lentils, tomato sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, to allow flavors to meld, about 15 minutes; keep warm.
- Prepare Carrot Dogs: Meanwhile, trim carrots to about 7 inches (see Cookâ€™s Note).
- Whisk together brown sugar, water, soy sauce, and liquid smoke in a large saucepan. Add carrots and enough additional water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Keep warm in cooking liquid until ready to serve; drain.
- Serve carrots in buns; top with chili, cheese, and reserved 1/2 cup onion. Serve with mustard. Cook's Notes: Tip: To make the carrots resemble hot dogs, use a veggie peeler to round the ends of the carrots. Vegan-ize: Omit cheese or use a vegan Cheddar. Make it Meaty: Substitute 8 hot dogs, heated according to package instructions, for the carrots and skip Steps 3 and 4.
