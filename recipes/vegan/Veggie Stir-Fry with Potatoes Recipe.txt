Ingredients:
- 2 pounds red potatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ large sweet onion, chopped
- ¾ cup pea pods
- 1 head bok choy, roughly chopped
- ½ cup bean sprouts
- ½ (6 ounce) bag baby spinach
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon chopped ginger (Optional)
- salt to taste

Directions:
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Boil on medium-high heat until tender but still intact, about 15 minutes. Drain.
- Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion; cook 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add pea pods, then add cooked potatoes and increase heat to medium. Cook 5 to 7 minutes more.
- Add bok choy, bean sprouts, and spinach. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; cook about 5 minutes. Add soy sauce and ginger. Cook, uncovered, until liquid evaporates and spinach wilted, about 5 minutes more; season with salt.
