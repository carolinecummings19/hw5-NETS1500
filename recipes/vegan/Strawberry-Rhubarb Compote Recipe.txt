Ingredients:
- 2 cups chopped fresh strawberries
- 2 cups chopped rhubarb
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

Directions:
- Combine chopped strawberries and rhubarb in a saucepan. Add sugar and salt; stir to coat evenly. Let sit until fruit has released its juices, about 10 minutes.
- Bring fruit mixture to a light boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is soft and mixture has thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 30 minutes. Mixture will further thicken upon cooling. Place in a jar or storage container and refrigerate for up to a week.
