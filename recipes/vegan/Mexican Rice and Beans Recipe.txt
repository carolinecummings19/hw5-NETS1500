Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 small poblano pepper, diced
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 cups vegetable broth

Directions:
- Heat olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, poblano pepper, and garlic in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is completely coated in oil, about 2 minutes. Season with paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, and black pepper.
- Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth and pinto beans. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
