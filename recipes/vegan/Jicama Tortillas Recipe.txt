Ingredients:
- 1 large jicama

Directions:
- Wash jicama thoroughly with cool water and remove all dirt using a vegetable brush. Trim both ends of the jicama and peel with a vegetable peeler, removing all skin and tough flesh.
- Cut jicama first in half crosswise, then cut each half into paper-thin slices using a sharp knife or the thinnest blade of a mandoline.
- Use them immediately as crisp tortillas, or store them for up to a week in a resealable plastic bag in the fridge.
