Ingredients:

- 6 large sprigs dill
- ¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Inspect six 1/2-pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- While the jars are being sterilized, stir together vinegar, water, and salt in a large saucepan. Add garlic and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Trim green beans to 1/4-inch shorter than the jars. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Remove jars from simmering water. Place 1 sprig of dill and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes in each jar. Pack in green beans standing on end. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Ladle boiling brine (leave out garlic) into the jars, filling within 1/4-inch of the tops. Seal jars with lids and rings. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a simmer (do not boil), cover, and process for 10 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Remove jars from the stockpot and cool to room temperature, 8 to 12 hours. Test jars for a good seal by pressing on the center of the lid — it should not move. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Let green beans ferment for 2 to 3 weeks in a cool, dark space before eating. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
