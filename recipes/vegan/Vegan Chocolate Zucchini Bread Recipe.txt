Ingredients:
- ¾ cup cane sugar
- ¾ cup almond milk
- ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
- ¼ cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup grated zucchini
- ½ cup vegan chocolate chips

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Beat cane sugar, almond milk, applesauce, coconut oil, and vanilla together in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer.
- Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Slowly add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, using an electric mixer, until it is all mixed well together. Stir in the zucchini and 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
- Pour batter into the prepared bread pan and sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Once removed from the pan, allow to cool completely before slicing.
