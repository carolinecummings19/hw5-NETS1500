Ingredients:
- 1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 cup kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
- 4 white mushrooms, sliced
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons prepared pesto
- Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
- Place squash skin-side down on prepared baking sheet. Bake until cooked through, about 1 hour. Remove from oven; cool for 10 minutes. Once squash is cool enough to handle, scrape flesh into string-like strands with a fork. Place in a bowl and set aside.
- Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to turn translucent. Stir in kale and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium low.
- Stir in squash, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes; cook for 2 minutes. Remove from stove and place squash mixture in a large bowl.
- Stir olive oil and pesto into the squash mixture. Slowly add grated Parmesan cheese, stirring until evenly mixed.
