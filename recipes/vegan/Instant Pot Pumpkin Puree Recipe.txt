Ingredients:
- 1 cup water
- 1 sugar pumpkin

Directions:
- Pour water into the inner lining of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Set trivet inside.
- Cut around the pumpkin stem to make a hole large enough to fit your hand into the pumpkin. Remove stem, then remove seeds and stringy pieces from inside pumpkin. Place pumpkin with the cut-side down on the trivet. If pumpkin is too large to fit in the pot, cut in half and arrange both halves to fit.
- Close and lock the lid; set valve to sealing. Select manual mode according to manufacturer's instructions and set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove pumpkin from the pot and set on a rack until cook enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
- Scrape pumpkin flesh from the skin and place into a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.
