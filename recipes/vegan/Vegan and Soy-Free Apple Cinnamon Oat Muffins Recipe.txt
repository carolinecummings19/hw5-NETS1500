Ingredients:
- 2 ½ cups gluten-free rolled oats
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 apples, chopped
- ½ cup applesauce
- ½ cup almond milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease or line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
- Use a blender or food processor to blend oats into oat flour. Mix in cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt.
- Mix apples, applesauce, almond milk, oil, and vanilla together in a large bowl until combined. Slowly add the oat mixture, mixing until thick like cookie dough. Add even spoonfuls of the mixture to the muffin tins.
- Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back to the touch, 14 to 18 minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes before serving.
