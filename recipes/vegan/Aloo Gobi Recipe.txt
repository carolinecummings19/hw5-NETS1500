Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon cumin seed
- 1 small onion, quartered and sliced
- 2 serrano chile peppers, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger paste
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- ¼ teaspoon paprika
- 2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
- Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds; cook until turn golden brown and begin to pop, a few seconds. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion; cook until lightly browned. Stir in serrano chiles and ginger paste; cook 1 minute. Season with coriander, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, and paprika; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
- Add potatoes and salt to the pot; cover and cook 5 to 7 minutes. Add cauliflower; cover and steam in its own juices until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil around edges of the pot. Increase heat to medium-high; cook to brown, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring gently to avoid mashing cauliflower.
