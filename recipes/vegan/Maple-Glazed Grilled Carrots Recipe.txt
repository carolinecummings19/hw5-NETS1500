Ingredients:
- 1 pound carrots, peeled and trimmed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Brush carrots with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
- Place carrots on the grill, perpendicular to the grates. Reduce heat to medium and cook, turning them regularly, until carrots have started to caramelize and are cooked throughout, 14 to 18 minutes. Move them to indirect heat and continue cooking if they start burning.
- Brush carrots with maple syrup and grill 1 minute more before transferring to a plate. Serve immediately.
