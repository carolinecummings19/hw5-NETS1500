Ingredients:
- 4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 teaspoons curry powder
- 4 teaspoons garam masala
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced
- 1 Â½ teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained
- 1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
