Ingredients:
- 2 cups fine bulgur
- ½ cup dry garbanzo beans
- ½ cup dry white beans
- ½ cup raisins
- 15 cups water
- 3 cups white sugar
- ¼ cup dried apricots
- ¼ cup orange peel, chopped
- 5 whole cloves
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
- 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
- 2 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts
- 2 tablespoons dried currants
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
- To make the pudding: Place bulgur, garbanzo beans, white beans, and raisins in 4 separate bowls and add water to cover. Let stand overnight.
- The next day, combine garbanzo beans and white beans in a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until beans are tender, 1 to 1 ½ hours. Drain and set aside.
- Drain bulgur and transfer to a large saucepan. Add 15 cups water (3 quarts plus 3 cups) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes, skimming and discarding any foam that appears.
- When bulgur has thickened, stir in sugar and bring mixture to a boil. Add cooked beans to bulgur mixture. Stir in drained raisins, apricots, orange peel, and cloves. Reduce heat and simmer until pudding thickens and fruit is tender, about 15 minutes.
- Pour pudding into individual serving bowls. Garnish with sesame seeds, walnuts, pistachios, currants, and cinnamon. Allow pudding to cool, then serve.
