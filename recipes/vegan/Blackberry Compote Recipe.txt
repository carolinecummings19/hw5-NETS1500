Ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh blackberries
- Â¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 pinch salt

Directions:
- Combine blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a saucepan. Toss to coat and let sit for 5 minutes.
- Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 15 to 20 minutes.
- Remove from the heat and cool for a few minutes before serving, or refrigerate for later use; it will thicken further as it cools.
