Ingredients:
- 5 large green plantains, coarsely chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) can organic tomato sauce
- 1 small bunch cilantro, chopped, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons homemade sofrito
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste, divided
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
- Â½ cup vegetable broth, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Fill a 1-quart pot with water; boil plantains with a pinch of salt until easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.
- Mash plantains with tomato sauce, cilantro, sofrito, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, and sazon in a mortar or glass bowl. Incorporate the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and enough vegetable broth to ensure that mofongo sticks together but is dry enough to easily slip out of a container. Season with salt and pepper.
- Serve mofongo on top of the remaining 5 tablespoons vegetable broth in a bowl.
