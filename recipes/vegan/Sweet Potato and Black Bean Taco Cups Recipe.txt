Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- 12 (4-inch) flour tortillas
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup peeled and chopped sweet potato
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (15-ounces) can black beans in mild chili sauce, undrained
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 ounces shredded queso quesadilla or Mexican-style cheese blend
- 1 small avocado, diced
- chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
- lime wedges and lime crema, for serving

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray. Press 1 tortilla into the bottom of each muffin cup, pleating edges as needed to fit.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sweet potato; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Add onion; cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add jalapeño and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans, salt, and black pepper.
- Divide bean mixture evenly among prepared muffin cups and sprinkle with cheese.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and filling is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Top with avocado and garnish with cilantro. Serve with limes and lime crema.
