Ingredients:
- 2 pounds red potatoes, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ bunch Italian parsley, chopped
- ½ bunch fresh basil, chopped
- 4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:

- Place cubed potatoes in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak for at least 5 minutes.

- Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the bottom and edges, about 35 minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare the chimichurri; combine parsley, basil, garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, vinegar, and a pinch salt in a bowl. Stir together and let sit while potatoes finish baking.
