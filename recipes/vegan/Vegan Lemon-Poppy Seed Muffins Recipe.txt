Ingredients:
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
- 2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons lemon extract
- ½ cup coconut milk beverage (such as Silk®)
- 1 cup flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup mashed banana (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 9 muffin cups or line cups with paper liners.
- Whisk sugar, lemon juice, oil, lemon zest, and lemon extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Add coconut milk and stir until well combined. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into sugar mixture. Fold in mashed banana and poppy seeds.
- Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
- Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 25 minutes.
- Mix confectioners' sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice together in a bowl. Brush glaze on top of the cooled muffins.
