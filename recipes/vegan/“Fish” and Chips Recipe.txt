Ingredients:
- 2 (14-ounce) cans no-salt-added young jackfruit, drained (such as Native Forest®)
- 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons crumbled nori
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- vegetable oil for frying (about 8 cups)
- 1/2 (28 ounce) package frozen steak fries
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 (12 ounce) bottle light beer or sparkling water (1 1/2 cups)
- 1 large egg
- chopped fresh parsley for garnish
- tartar sauce ,for serving
- lemon wedges, for serving

Directions:
- For “fish,” process jackfruit, panko, nori, mayonnaise, mustard, 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, and salt in a food processor until combined, with some chunks of jackfruit remaining. Mixture should hold together when pressed.
- Shape jackfruit mixture into 1/3-cup fllet-like portions (about 3-1/2x1-1/2 inches). Cover and chill for 1 hour.
- Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot or deep fryer. Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, prepare fries according to package directions; keep warm.
- For batter, whisk together flour, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and remaining 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning in a medium bowl. Whisk in beer and egg. Dip jackfruit portions into batter, turning to coat all sides.
- Working in batches, fry 2 or 3 portions at a time in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; keep warm. Garnish with parsley and serve with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and steak fries. Cook’s Note Vegan-ize: Substitute vegan mayo, omit the egg, and serve with malt vinegar instead of tartar sauce. Make it Meaty: Replace the jackfruit mixture with 4 (4-ounce) cod fillets and skip Steps 1 and 2. Pat fish dry and continue as directed in Step 3, except fry until an instant-read thermometer inserted into fish registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
