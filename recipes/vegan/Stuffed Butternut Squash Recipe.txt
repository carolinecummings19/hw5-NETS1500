Ingredients:
- 1 butternut squash, halved and seeded
- ½ cup basmati rice
- 6 Brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered lengthwise
- 1 medium carrot, peeled, sliced and julienned
- ⅓ (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans
- ¼ cup soy milk
- 3 tablespoons tamari
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place squash in a baking dish with one inch of water, and cover with foil.
- Bake squash in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until flesh is fork-tender. Keep warm.
- In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Meanwhile, place Brussels sprouts, carrots, and garbanzo beans in a skillet over medium high heat. Stir together soy milk, tamari, turmeric, and garlic, and add to the skillet, tossing to coat. Cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender. Add a small amount of water or more soy-tamari mixture, as needed, to prevent drying out. Combine rice with vegetable mixture, and scoop into squash. Serve with additional tamari and season to taste. Enjoy!
