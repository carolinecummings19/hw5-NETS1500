Ingredients:
- 2 cups uncooked glutinous (sticky) white rice, rinsed
- 1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk, divided
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cubed

Directions:
- Cover rice with several inches of fresh water in a microwave-safe bowl; let stand for 30 minutes. Drain off water so rice is covered by 1/4 inch of water.
- Microwave rice, covered, on High until water is mostly absorbed but rice is still wet, about 10 minutes; stir and cook until almost dry, 4 minutes more.
- Combine 1/2 coconut milk and 1 cup sugar in a bowl, stirring until sugar dissolved. Pour over rice; stir until rice coated. Cover and let rice stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- Pour remaining 1/2 can coconut milk into a saucepan; whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, cornstarch, and salt until smooth. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly; simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; cool.
- Scoop rice into individual serving bowls; top each serving with about 2 tablespoons coconut sauce and several mango pieces.
