Ingredients:
- 14 ounces dry brown lentils
- 2 carrots, grated
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons water, or more as needed
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon yellow curry powder (Optional)
- 4 cups cooked brown rice, or as needed

Directions:
- Fill a large pot with lightly salted water; add lentils and bring to a rolling boil. Cook until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Add grated carrots; cook until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Drain lentils and carrots.
- Heat olive oil in the same pot over medium heat; add onions and garlic. Cook and stir until onions wilt and become transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lentils and carrots and reduce heat to medium-low. Add enough water to the pot to keep the lentil mixture from drying out.
- Sprinkle cumin, cayenne, curry powder, salt, and pepper over lentils; stir until heated through and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice.
