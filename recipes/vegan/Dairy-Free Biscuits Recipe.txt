Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegan butter (such as Earth BalanceÂ®)
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 cup cold unsweetened almond milk, or as needed

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat.
- Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
- Slowly stir in cold almond milk, adding just enough for a wet and sticky dough to come together.
- Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times. Gently roll or pat dough to a thickness of 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass. Gently re-roll dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits for a total of 12.
- Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet so they are touching each other. Don't be afraid to squish them together as this helps them to rise even higher.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
