Ingredients:
- 8 egg yolks
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange zest
- ¾ cup matzo cake meal
- ¼ cup potato starch
- 8 egg whites
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons fresh orange juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and line the bottom of a 10-inch tube pan with parchment paper.
- Whisk egg yolks in a medium bowl until lighter in color. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and orange zest; continue whisking until thick and pale, about 7 minutes.
- Sift matzo cake meal and potato starch together; set aside.
- Beat egg whites in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until foamy. Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Fold matzo mixture into yolk mixture alternately with orange juice. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
- Bake cake in the preheated oven, checking after 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Invert onto a wire rack to cool. Run a knife around the sides of the cake before removing from the pan.
