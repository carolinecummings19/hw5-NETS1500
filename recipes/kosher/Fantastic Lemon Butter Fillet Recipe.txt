- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 (4 ounce) fillets cod

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix in lemon juice, salt, pepper, parsley flakes, and garlic. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir about 10 minutes, until thickened.
- Arrange cod fillets in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Cover with 1/2 the butter mixture, and sprinkle with lemon pepper. Cover with foil.
