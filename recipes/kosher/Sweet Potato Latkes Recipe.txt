Ingredients:
- 1 large sweet potato, peeled and grated
- ½ onion, grated
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, or more if needed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup applesauce
- 1 cup plain nonfat yogurt

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
- Fill a bowl with lightly-salted water. Rinse grated sweet potato in the water, and drain into a sieve. Pat grated sweet potato dry with a cloth or paper towels, then place into a bowl. Squeeze excess moisture from grated onion, and place into the bowl with sweet potato. Stir eggs and pepper into mixture until well combined.
- Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of the potato mixture per patty into hot oil. Flatten patties with a fork, and fry until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 5 to 8 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side, sprinkle with salt, then set the cooked patties aside on the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven while you finish cooking the latkes. Stir potato mixture before cooking each batch of patties. Serve hot with applesauce and yogurt.
