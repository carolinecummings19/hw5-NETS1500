- Place roast in a roasting pan with the fatty side up. Spread mixture over the top of roast; let roast sit out until it is at room temperature, no longer than 1 hour. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
- Bake roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue roasting for an additional 60 to 75 minutes. The internal temperature of the roast should be at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Allow roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can retain its juices. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
