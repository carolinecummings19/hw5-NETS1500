Ingredients:
- ¾ cup milk
- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 5 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup margarine, melted

Directions:
- Warm milk, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and mix in eggs and yeast until well combined.
- Measure flour into a large bowl; make a well in the center of flour. Pour milk mixture into the well; do not stir. Cover with a lid and let stand for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Pour melted margarine into flour mixture; mix well. Add more flour if too sticky. Knead lightly. Cover and let rise for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Shape dough into 16 rolls and place on a baking sheet. Cover and let rise again for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
- Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown and bounce back when gently pressed, about 15 minutes.
