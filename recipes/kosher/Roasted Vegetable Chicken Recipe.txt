Ingredients:
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken
- salt and pepper to taste
- 6 whole onions
- 6 potatoes, peeled
- 4 carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
- 4 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 cup water

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Season chicken with salt and pepper; place in a large roasting pan. Arrange onions, potatoes, carrots, and celery around chicken. Pour water into the pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.
- Roast in the preheated oven, basting occasionally, until chicken is golden brown, about 2 hours; remove aluminum foil for the last 30 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow chicken to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
