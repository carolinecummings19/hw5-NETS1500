Ingredients:
- 1 medium Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and coarsely shredded
- 2 medium Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup golden raisins
- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon whole milk

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Place shredded and chopped apples in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, golden raisins, flour, and salt; set aside. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Working with one sheet at a time, place puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll lightly with a rolling pin into an approximately 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Arrange 1/2 of the apple filling (about 3 cups) down one side of pastry lengthwise. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Fold pastry lengthwise over apple mixture; dampen edges of pastry with water, then press or crimp edges to seal. Repeat process with 2nd pastry sheet and remaining apple mixture.
- Transfer to prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2-inches between each pastry. Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl; brush on top of each pastry. Cut 3 or 4 slits on top of each pastry to allow steam to escape. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
