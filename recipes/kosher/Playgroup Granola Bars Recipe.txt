Ingredients:
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup raisins (Optional)
- ½ cup wheat germ
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 egg, beaten
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
- Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, raisins, wheat germ, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; pour in honey, oil, egg, and vanilla; mix well using your hands. Pat evenly into the prepared pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until bars begin to turn golden at the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes, then cut into bars while still warm. Do not allow bars to cool completely before cutting or they will be too hard to cut.
