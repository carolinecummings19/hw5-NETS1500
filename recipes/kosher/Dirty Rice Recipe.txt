Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoons annatto or achiote powder (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ⅓ cups uncooked white rice
- 2 ¾ cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
- 1 ⅓ cups whole corn kernels, blanched

- ¼ cup toasted pine nuts
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
- In a heavy saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and the chopped onions; saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Mix in the bell pepper, chili powder, ground annatto, chili flakes, cumin, and cinnamon. Saute for 2 minutes.
