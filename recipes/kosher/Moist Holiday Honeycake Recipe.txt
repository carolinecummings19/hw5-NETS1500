Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- 3 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup canola oil
- 1 cup honey
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup strong brewed coffee (decaf is fine)
- ½ cup orange juice
- ¼ cup whiskey

Directions:
- Place an oven rack in an upper position in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt) with cooking spray.
- In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. In a separate large bowl, whisk together canola oil, honey, white and brown sugars, eggs, vanilla, coffee, orange juice, and whiskey. With an electric mixer, beat the flour mixture into the honey mixture just until thoroughly incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
- Bake on the upper shelf of the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs, about 1 hour. Cool for 20 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a serving platter.
