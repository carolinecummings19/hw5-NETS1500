Ingredients:
- 1 pound ground beef
- 6 red potatoes, finely diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 5 carrots, thinly sliced
- 1 Â½ cups water, divided
- 1 (46 fluid ounce) bottle tomato-vegetable juice cocktail
- 2 cups frozen green beans
- 1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Cook and stir beef, potatoes, and onion in a large pot over medium heat until beef is no longer pink. Cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
- Meanwhile, place carrots and 1/2 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until carrots are tender, about 5 minutes.
- Drain grease from beef mixture. Add carrots, juice cocktail, green beans, corn, remaining 1 cup water, salt, and pepper to the pot. Simmer over low heat until flavors are well blended and soup is hot, about 30 minutes.
