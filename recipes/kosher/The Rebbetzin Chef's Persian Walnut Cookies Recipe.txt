Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups finely ground walnuts
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 4 large egg yolks, divided
- 1 tablespoon ground cardamom
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 1 teaspoon water
- ½ cup walnut pieces for decoration

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Mix together ground walnuts, sugar, 3 egg yolks, cardamom, baking soda, and rose water in a medium bowl until well blended. Roll teaspoon-sized pieces of dough into balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
- Whisk together remaining egg yolk and water using a fork. Press a walnut piece into each cookie, then brush with egg yolk glaze.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. The cookies will appear soft and undercooked but they will harden considerably when cooled.
- Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
