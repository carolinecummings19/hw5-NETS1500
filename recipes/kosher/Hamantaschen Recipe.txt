Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ cup margarine, softened
- 2 eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup poppy seed filling, or as needed

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
- Mix flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Cut in margarine with 2 knives or a pastry blender. Add eggs and vanilla extract; mix well until dough comes together and is smooth. If dough is sticky, add more flour.
- Roll out dough on floured work surface until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Press the rim of a glass into flour and then into the dough to cut out circles.
- Place 1/2 teaspoon filling into the center of each circle. Fold up the 3 sides into a triangle shape, pinching the sides together tightly to seal. Transfer cookies to baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 25 minutes.
