Ingredients:
- 7 ½ cups sugar
- 3 fluid ounces liquid pectin

- 3 pounds quinces, cored and chopped, peels on
- ¼ cup lemon juice

Directions:
- Sterilize eight ½-pint jars in boiling water for at least 5 minutes, and have new lids ready.
- Place quinces in a large pot, and pour in water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Strain off 4 cups of juice. Mix juice with sugar and lemon juice in a heavy pot, and bring to a boil over high heat, constantly stirring. Stir in pectin, and return to a boil. Boil for 1 full minute, constantly stirring. Remove from heat and skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterile jars, and process for 10 minutes in a hot water bath to seal.
