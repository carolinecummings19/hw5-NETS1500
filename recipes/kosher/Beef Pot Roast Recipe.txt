- Arrange onion, garlic, and 1 bay leaf in the bottom of the pan; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Return meat to the pan, place remaining bay leaf on top of meat, and cover. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cook in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue cooking until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
