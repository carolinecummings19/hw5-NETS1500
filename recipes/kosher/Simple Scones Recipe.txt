- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
- Mix flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Grate butter into flour mixture on the large holes of a box grater. Use your fingers to work in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, then toss in raisins. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Whisk sour cream and egg together in a small bowl until combined. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Stir sour cream mixture into flour mixture using a fork until large dough clumps form. Use your hands to shape dough into a ball. (Dough may seem dry at first but will come together as you work it.) Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7 to 8-inch circle, about 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 equal triangles; place on the prepared baking tray, about 1-inch apart. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
