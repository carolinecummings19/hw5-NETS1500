Ingredients:
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water, no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C)
- ½ cup warm milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 large eggs
- ⅓ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup water
- 4 cups vegetable oil, or as needed
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
- Sprinkle yeast over 1 cup warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
- Mix together warm milk, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour in yeast mixture and stir to combine.
- Beat in flour, eggs, and butter until mixture forms a smooth, soft dough. Cover the bowl and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Stir dough well, cover, and let rise again for 30 more minutes.
- Meanwhile, mix together honey and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and allow honey syrup to cool.
- Heat 2 inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Place a large serving or soup spoon in a glass of water near dough. Scoop up about 2 tablespoons dough per puff with the wet spoon, drop it into the wet palm of your hand, and roll it back into the spoon to create a round shape. Do not overhandle the puffy, soft dough.
- Drop dough balls into hot oil in batches, wetting the spoon each time you make a dough ball. Fry in hot oil until golden brown on the bottom, then roll them over to cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Gently set loukoumades aside to drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
- Place loukoumades on a baking sheet. Drizzle with honey syrup and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm.
