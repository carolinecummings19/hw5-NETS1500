Ingredients:
- 2 pounds fresh grouper fillets
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Lightly grease a baking pan.
- Place grouper fillets on the prepared baking pan; brush with lemon juice. Combine Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
- Broil fillets in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 to 6 minutes; remove the pan from the oven and spread cheese mixture on top of fillets.
- Return to the broiler for an additional 30 seconds, or until topping is browned and bubbly.
