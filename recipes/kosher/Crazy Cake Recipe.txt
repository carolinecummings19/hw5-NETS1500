- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups cold water

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Sift flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt into a 9x13-inch ungreased baking dish; form 3 wells in flour mixture. Pour oil into the first well, vinegar into the second, and vanilla into the third. Pour cold water over all and stir well with a fork.
