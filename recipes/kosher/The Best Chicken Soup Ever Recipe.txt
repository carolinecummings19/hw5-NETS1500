Ingredients:
- 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
- 10 cups water, or as needed to cover
- 3 stalks celery with leaves, chopped and separated
- 1 pound baby carrots
- 2 onions, chopped
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled
- 1 packet chicken noodle soup mix
- 5 black peppercorns
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 pinch dried thyme
- 1 pinch poultry seasoning
- 1 pinch dried basil
- 1 pinch dried parsley
- 1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta

Directions:
- Place chicken into a large pot; cover with water. Add celery leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove chicken from the pot and place in a bowl until cool enough to handle.
- Meanwhile, strain cooking liquid, discard celery leaves, and return cooking liquid to the pot. Place carrots, onion, celery stalks, chicken broth, bouillon, and soup mix into the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, poultry seasoning, basil, and parsley.
- Bone chicken; cut meat into bite-sized pieces and add to the pot. Simmer until vegetables are tender and flavors are well blended, about 90 minutes.
- Stir in pasta; cook until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.
