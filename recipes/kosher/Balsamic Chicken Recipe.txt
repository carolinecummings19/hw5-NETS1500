Ingredients:
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients.
- Whisk together chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, sugar, Italian seasoning, and garlic in a bowl. Place chicken breasts in marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes on each side.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Place chicken in the hot skillet and cook until browned and no longer pink inside, about 7 minutes per side.
- Pour marinade into the skillet. Cook until sauce thickens slightly, turning chicken breasts over once or twice, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
