Ingredients:
- ½ teaspoon vegetable oil
- 2 cups hot water
- 2 (6-inch) matzo sheets
- 2 large eggs
- ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon butter, divided
- kosher salt to taste

Directions:
- Heat vegetable oil in a nonstick frying pan over low heat.
- Pour hot water into a bowl. Break matzo sheets into small chunks and soak in hot water, about 2 minutes.
- Whisk eggs and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt in a separate bowl. Strain matzo and shake to remove excess water; stir matzo into egg mixture.
- Pour heated oil out of the frying pan; place 1/2 tablespoon butter into the hot pan.
- Pour matzo and egg mixture into hot butter; cover and cook until a pattie forms, about 10 minutes.
- Slide matzo pattie onto a plate.
- Place remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter into the hot pan.
- Place a second plate over matzo pattie and flip over, so the uncooked side is on the bottom.
- Slide matzo pattie into the pan with hot butter; cover and cook until the bottom is browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and season with kosher salt.
