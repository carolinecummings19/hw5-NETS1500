Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 large egg
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- ½ cup sparkling apple cider
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon sparkling apple cider, or as needed to make glaze

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Melt butter over medium-high heat and cook until it turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Add apples and cook over medium-high heat until apples just begin to soften around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon sugar and continue cooking another 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain in a strainer; let cool to room temperature. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl until well combined. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Whisk egg, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter together in a separate mixing bowl. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Add cooled apple pieces and sparkling apple cider; add the flour mixture. Stir just until flour is incorporated. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spoon about 2 tablespoons batter per fritter, into hot oil, slightly flattening them out. Cook in batches. Fry on one side until small bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip fritters over and fry the other side until richly browned, about 2 more minutes.

- Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain grease. Cool slightly before glazing. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Whisk powdered sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Add enough apple cider, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form a smooth glaze that is just runny enough to drizzle over fritters. Enjoy! Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
