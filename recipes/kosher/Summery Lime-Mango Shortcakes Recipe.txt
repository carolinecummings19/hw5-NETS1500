Ingredients:
- 2 ripe mangoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
- ¾ cup fresh blueberries
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 ½ teaspoons lime juice
- ½ teaspoon unflavored gelatin
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon coconut extract (Optional)
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon grated lime zest
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ cup vegetable shortening
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
- Combine mango, strawberries, and blueberries in a large bowl. Toss gently with honey and lime juice. Cover fruit filling and refrigerate.
- Sprinkle gelatin over water in a large heatproof bowl. Let bloom, about 5 minutes. Place bowl over a pan of simmering water; stir often until dissolved. Transfer to a small bowl; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes. Beat cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer. When cream begins to thicken, add confectioners' sugar, coconut extract, and gelatin. Whip until soft peaks form; cover cream and refrigerate.
- Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, lime zest, poppy seeds, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat egg and buttermilk in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Knead on a floured work surface until dough comes together. Roll to 1/2 inch thickness; cut shortcakes with a 3-inch round biscuit cutter. Place on prepared baking sheet.
- Bake shortcakes in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool slightly; halve each cake horizontally.
- Spoon fruit filling on bottom halves of each cake. Spoon or pipe cream evenly over fruit. Top each with remaining biscuit halves.
