- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make the crunchy topping: Melt butter in a pot. Stir ramen noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds into the pot with melted butter. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Spoon the mixture onto a baking sheet and bake the crunchies in the preheated oven, turning often to make sure they do not burn, for 5 to 7 minutes. When they are browned remove them from the oven. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Make the dressing: Heat oil, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce together in a small saucepan. Bring the dressing to a boil, let boil for 1 minute. Remove the pan from heat and let cool. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Toss together cabbage with crunchy topping and dressing immediately before serving. Serve right away or the crunchies will get soggy. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
