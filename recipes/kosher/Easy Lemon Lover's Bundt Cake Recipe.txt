Ingredients:
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix
- 1 cup sour cream
- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 (3 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix
- 1 lemon, zested, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds, or more to taste (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube cake pan.
- Beat cake mix, sour cream, eggs, vegetable oil, lemon juice, pudding mix, lemon zest, poppy seeds, and lemon extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. Increase speed to medium; beat for 3 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Tap the pan firmly a few times, then shake it gently to loosen the cake. Place the wire rack over the pan and invert to release cake onto the rack; cool completely.
