Ingredients:
- 1 cup cake flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar, divided
- 12 egg whites
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and fully dry a 10-inch tube pan.
- Sift together flour, and 3/4 cup sugar, set aside.
- Whip egg whites, along with vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt, in a large bowl to medium stiff peaks. Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. When the egg white mixture has reached its maximum volume, fold in the sifted ingredients gradually, 1/3 at a time. Do not overmix. Put the batter into the tube pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched, 40 to 45 minutes.
- Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to prevent decompression while cooling. When cool, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert onto a plate.
