Ingredients:
- 3 pounds unpeeled red potatoes
- 4 eggs
- 1 ½ cups mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- ½ cup sliced green onions
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup sliced celery

Directions:
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add red potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop into 1 inch cubes. Place in a medium bowl.
- Place eggs in a medium saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and dice.
