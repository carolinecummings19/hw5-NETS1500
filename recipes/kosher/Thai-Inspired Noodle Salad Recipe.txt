Ingredients:
- 15 ounces dried soba noodles
- ⅓ cup rice vinegar
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- 1 lime, zested and juiced
- 1 ½ teaspoons dark sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, or to taste (Optional)
- 1 cup finely grated carrot
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped salted peanuts

Directions:
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba noodles in boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, rinse with cold water, and set aside.
- Pour rice vinegar, soy sauce, lime juice, and sesame oil into a large bowl. Mix in brown sugar, lime zest, garlic, and red pepper flakes; stir until sugar dissolves. Toss in carrot, cilantro, and peanuts until well combined.
- Cut noodles into 3-inch lengths. Stir into carrot mixture. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
- Toss salad again before serving. If dry, splash with soy sauce and rice vinegar. Serve cold.
