- Combine soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on medium power for 1 minute, then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds, watching closely to prevent boiling. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over top and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Meanwhile, remove chicken from marinade; transfer marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 1 minute. Set aside for basting. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cook chicken on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until golden brown on all sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
