- Add 1 ½ tablespoons sugar, 4 teaspoons salt, and white pepper; continue to chop until very well blended. Stir in ice water a little at a time throughout this process. Add matzo meal and chop again until mixture is thick enough to bind together to make a ball; if not, add more matzo meal. Set aside. Allrecipes / Christine Ma
