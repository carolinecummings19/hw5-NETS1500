Ingredients:
- 1 (10 fluid ounce) bottle Russian-style salad dressing
- 1 cup apricot preserves
- 1 Â½ ounces dry onion soup mix
- 6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken into a 4-quart casserole dish.
- Mix salad dressing, jam, and soup mix together in a bowl until well combined; pour over chicken.
- Cover the dish and bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
