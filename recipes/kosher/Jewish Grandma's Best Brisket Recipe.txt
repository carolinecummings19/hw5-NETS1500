Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 (4 pound) beef brisket
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 onions, thickly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- Heat oil in a large deep skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Season brisket generously with black pepper. Place in the pan and cook until surface is a rich brown color, not burnt, but dark. Lift the roast and scatter onions in the pan. Place the uncooked side of the roast down onto onions. Repeat the browning process.
- Add garlic to the pan, and fill with enough water to almost cover the roast. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cover with a lid or tight-fitting aluminum foil. Simmer for 4 hours, turning the roast over once halfway through. The roast should be fork tender.
- Remove the brisket to a serving platter. Bring broth in the pan to a simmer, scraping the bottom to loosen any browned bits. Cook until reduced to a thin gravy. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed.
