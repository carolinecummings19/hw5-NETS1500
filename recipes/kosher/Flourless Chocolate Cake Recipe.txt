- Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour chocolate into the bowl of an electric mixer. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into chocolate until combined. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Beat in hot sugar water. Slowly beat in eggs, one at a time. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Have a pan larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in the larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet. Place cake in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for 10 seconds and invert onto a serving plate. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Serve and enjoy! Morgan Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Josh Hoggle
