- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
- Whisk flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Stir in water, bananas, and vanilla until combined; dough will be smooth and sticky.
- Heat 3 inches oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
