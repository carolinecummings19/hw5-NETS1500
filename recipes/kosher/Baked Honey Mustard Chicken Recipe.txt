- Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn chicken pieces over and brush with remaining honey mustard mixture. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
