Ingredients:
- 5 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 medium apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
- To make the cinnamon-sugar: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.
- To make the cake: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in oil, eggs, orange juice, and vanilla until well combined.
- Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan, then top with 1/2 of the sliced apples and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon-sugar. Repeat once more with remaining batter, apples, and cinnamon-sugar.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 to 90 minutes. Cool briefly in the pan; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or rack and let cool completely.
