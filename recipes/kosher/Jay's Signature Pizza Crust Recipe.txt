- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ½ teaspoon brown sugar

- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake immediately. If baking dough on a pan, lightly oil the pan and let dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before topping and baking it.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
