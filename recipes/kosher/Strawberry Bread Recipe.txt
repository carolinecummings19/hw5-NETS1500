Ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh strawberries
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 3 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1 ¼ cups chopped pecans

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
- Slice strawberries and place in a medium-sized bowl. Sprinkle lightly with 1 tablespoon sugar and toss to coat.
- Combine flour, 2 cups sugar, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in large bowl; mix well.
- Blend oil and eggs into strawberries. Add strawberry mixture to flour mixture, blending until dry ingredients are just moistened. Stir in pecans. Divide batter into pans.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes (test each loaf separately).
- Remove from the oven and let cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn loaves out of pans, and allow to cool before slicing.
