Ingredients:
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- ¾ cup dried apricots, chopped
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup seedless raspberry preserves
- 1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
- Beat butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer on low speed in a bowl until blended and smooth. Beat in vanilla extract, salt, 1 cup flour, and 1/4 cup sugar until blended. Stir in remaining flour by hand using a spoon.
- Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Wrap each piece with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.
- Stir walnuts, apricots, brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl until well-mixed. Set filling aside.
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with foil and grease foil.
- Roll one piece of chilled dough on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 9-inch round. Spread 2 tablespoons raspberry preserves on top. Sprinkle with about 1/2 cup apricot filling; gently press filling onto dough. Cut dough into 12 equal wedges with a sharp knife or pastry wheel. Starting at curved edge, roll up each wedge, jelly-roll fashion. Place cookies on the prepared sheets, point-side down, about 1/2 inch apart. Repeat with remaining dough.
- Mix remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Use a pastry brush to brush rugelach with milk. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
- Bake rugelach in the preheated oven on 2 racks until golden, 30 to 35 minutes; rotate cookie sheets between upper and lower racks halfway through baking time. Immediately remove rugelach to wire racks to cool. Store cooled rugelach in a tightly covered container.
