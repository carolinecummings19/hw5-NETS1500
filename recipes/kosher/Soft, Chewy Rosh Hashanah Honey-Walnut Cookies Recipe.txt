Ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ cup chopped walnuts
- ¾ cup unsalted butter
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup honey
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
- Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in walnuts.
- Beat butter and brown sugar together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy; stir in honey, egg, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Stir flour mixture into honey mixture just until well combined (don't overmix). Chill dough at least 1 hour or overnight.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
- Scoop about 1 tablespoon dough and roll into a ball for each cookie; place onto the prepared baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until just puffy (or a little bit flat in the middle for a gooey texture), 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets about 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
