Ingredients:
- ½ cup pareve margarine
- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 5 large eggs, separated
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 cup ground almonds

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with foil. Grease foil.
- Melt margarine and chocolate over low heat. Stir until smooth and let cool.
- Beat egg whites in a medium-sized mixing bowl until stiff; about 2 minutes. Beat egg yolks and sugar together in a separate bowl until thick and pale; about 1 minute. Blend in chocolate mixture and stir in ground almonds. Fold beaten whites, 1/3 at a time, into chocolate until no streaks of white remain; transfer into prepared pan.
- Place an 8-inch baking pan with 1 inch of water in it on the bottom rack of the oven (this will create steam and make the torte more moist).
- Bake torte on center rack in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until sides begin to pull away from pan and top is set in center. Cover the torte loosely with foil for the last 20 minutes of baking. Note: Don't worry if the cake cracks because the top will be on the bottom later.
- Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes and then carefully remove sides of pan. Invert onto a serving plate and cool completely.
