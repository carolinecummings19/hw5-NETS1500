Ingredients:
- 1 (12 ounce) bag egg noodles
- 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
- 12 ounces farmer cheese
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 6 large eggs, beaten
- 1 large apple - peeled, cored, and diced
- ¼ cup golden raisins, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
- Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.
- While noodles are cooking, mix sour cream, cheese, sugar, and butter together in a large bowl. Add eggs, apple, and raisins. Add drained egg noodles and cinnamon; stir until well combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden brown and custard has set, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
