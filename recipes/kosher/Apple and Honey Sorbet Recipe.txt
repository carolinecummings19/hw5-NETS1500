Ingredients:
- 1 ¼ pounds Granny Smith apples, cored and thinly sliced
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- 1 ½ lemons, juiced
- 1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
- In a large, resealable plastic bag or plastic container with a lid, mix apples with the juice of 1/2 lemon. Freeze for several hours or overnight.
- In a small saucepan, bring water and sugar to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in honey. Cool completely.
- Place apple in a blender, and liquidize them with juice of 1 lemon and the cooled sugar syrup until as smooth as possible. The peel will add texture, and prevent the mixture from being completely smooth.
- Transfer the mixture to an ice cream machine and freeze according to directions. Leave the sorbet out to soften 10 minutes prior to serving.
