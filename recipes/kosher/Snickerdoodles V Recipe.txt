Ingredients:
- 1 cup shortening
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 ¾ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
- In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended.
- In a small shallow bowl, stir together the 2 tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be slightly golden at the edges. Remove to cool on wire racks.
