Ingredients:
- 2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F)
- 1 ½ cups lukewarm milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- ⅓ cup shortening
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- ⅓ cup butter
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla
- 4 tablespoons hot water or as needed

Directions:
- Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Mix yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour together in a large bowl for a few minutes with an electric mixer at low speed, or stir with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to ½-inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide donuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn donuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry donuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip donuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
