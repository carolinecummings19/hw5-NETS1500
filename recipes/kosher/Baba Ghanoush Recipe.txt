Ingredients:
- 1 large eggplant
- 2 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
- 1/4 cup tahini or to taste
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 Â½ tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
- Place eggplant on the prepared baking sheet, and pierce holes in the skin with a fork. Roast in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until very soft and tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Set eggplant aside until cool enough to handle; slice in half and scoop flesh into a colander or fine mesh sieve over a bowl; drain for 5 minutes.
- Place eggplant, lemon juice, tahini, sesame seeds, and garlic in blender, and puree. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
- Transfer eggplant mixture to a medium size mixing bowl, and slowly mix in olive oil. Refrigerate the baba ghanoush for 3 hours before serving.
