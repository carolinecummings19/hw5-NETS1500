Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped onion
- ¼ pound chicken livers, trimmed and chopped
- 2 tablespoons dry sherry
- ⅓ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- hot sauce to taste
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, onion, and chicken livers. Reduce heat to low, and sauté until chicken livers are tender and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
- Place chicken liver mixture in a blender; add dry sherry, cream cheese, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth; transfer to a medium bowl. For best results, cover and chill pâté in the refrigerator for approximately 2 hours before serving.
