Ingredients:
- 1 (2½ to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut up
- 2 small yellow onions, diced
- 2 stalks celery, cut into chunks
- 3 carrots, cut into chunks
- 1 bunch fresh dill
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 quarts water
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup matzo meal
- 3 quarts water, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
- To make the chicken soup: Combine chicken, onions, celery, carrots, dill, bay leaf, and 3 quarts water in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, partially covered, for at least five hours. Skim the surface of the soup occasionally to remove any foam that develops.
- Remove the chicken and vegetables from the broth; discard vegetables. Strain the broth, cool, and refrigerate overnight. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the chicken meat from the bones, and chop or shred the meat; cover and refrigerate.
- Combine vegetable oil, eggs, basil, parsley, 1 ½ teaspoons salt, and black pepper in a bowl; mix well. Stir in matzo meal, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour.
- Bring at least 3 quarts of water, or as needed, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a large pot. Using wet hands, gently shape the matzo mixture into 2-inch balls balls; drop them in the boiling water and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Skim fat off chilled chicken broth; transfer broth into a pot over medium heat. Add salt to taste and reserved cooked chicken, if desired (or save chicken for another use). Transfer cooked matzo balls to the chicken soup and heat to serve.
