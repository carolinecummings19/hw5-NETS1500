Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon fennel seeds
- ½ teaspoon asafoetida powder
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- 2 cups water
- 1 ⅛ cups white sugar
- 3 tablespoons tamarind paste

Directions:
- Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, ginger, cayenne pepper, fennel seeds, asafoetida powder, and garam masala; cook and stir for about 2 minutes to release the flavors.
- Stir water into the pan with the spices along with sugar and tamarind paste. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat until the mixture turns a deep chocolaty brown and is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. This should take 20 to 30 minutes. The sauce will be thin, but it will thicken upon cooling.
