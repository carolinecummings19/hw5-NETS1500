- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper

- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
- Remove lamb from marinade and leave any onions on that stick to meat; discard marinade. Wrap exposed ends of bones with aluminum foil to keep them from burning.
- Cook on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Serve hot and enjoy! DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
