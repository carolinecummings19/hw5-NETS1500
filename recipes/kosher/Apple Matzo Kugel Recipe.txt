Ingredients:
- 4 matzo sheets
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
- 2 apples - peeled, cored and cubed
- ½ cup raisins

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Break matzo sheets into pieces, and soak in a bowl of water until soft. Drain in a colander, mashing to squeeze the water out.
- Mix eggs, salt, sugar, oil, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Add soaked matzo and mix well. Fold in apples and raisins; spoon into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly.
- Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned and apples are tender, about 45 minutes.
