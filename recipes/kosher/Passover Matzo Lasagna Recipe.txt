Ingredients:
- 6 matzo sheets
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 (24 ounce) carton cottage cheese
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Soak matzo sheets in a large bowl of hot water until tender, about 30 seconds; drain.
- Combine eggs, cottage cheese, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Pour 1/2 cup of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Place 2 matzo sheets over the sauce, then pour another layer of sauce over matzo. Spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture on top, then another layer of sauce. Continue layering until all the matzo sheets are used, finishing with a layer of sauce. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese over the top.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, about 30 to 40 minutes.
