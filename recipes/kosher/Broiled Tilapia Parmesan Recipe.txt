Ingredients:
- ½ cup Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon celery salt
- 2 pounds tilapia fillets

Directions:
- Set an oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil.
- Mix Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise, lemon juice, basil, pepper, onion powder, and celery salt together in a bowl until well combined.
- Arrange tilapia fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan.
- Broil in the preheated oven for 4 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the oven and spread Parmesan mixture over fillets. Return to the oven and broil until topping is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 more minutes; be careful not to overcook. Tammy Lynn
