Ingredients:
- 2 cups packaged shredded potatoes
- 1/2 cup peeled and shredded Granny Smith apple
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
- Stir together potatoes, apple, egg yolk, flour, pepper, and salt in a large bowl.
- Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. Drop 4 (1/4-cup) scoops potato mixture into basket. Press gently with a spatula to flatten; lightly coat tops with cooking spray.
- Set the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook latkes, turning halfway through, until browned on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture. Garnish with sliced green onion and serve with sour cream or crème fraîche.
