Ingredients:
- ¾ cup dry garbanzo beans
- ¼ cup dried soybeans
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 onion, quartered
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 3 cups water
- 2 cloves cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup tahini
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
- Rinse the garbanzos and soybeans, and place them in a pressure cooker along with the bay leaf and onion. Add vegetable broth and enough water to cover the beans by 1 inch (or follow the manufacturer's instructions for the minimum amount of liquid required).
- Seal the lid and bring the pressure up to high; reduce the heat to low and cook, maintaining high pressure, for 1 hour. Allow the pressure to drop naturally.
- Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Place the beans in the bowl of a food processor. Add the garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce, black pepper, and tahini; process until smooth. (You may add some of the cooking liquid for a thinner consistency.) Scoop the mixture into a bowl, and mix in the parsley.
