Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups butter or margarine, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 6 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (12 ounce) can poppyseed filling

Directions:
- Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in orange juice and vanilla until well combined. Mix in baking powder, then gradually stir in flour until dough forms a ball. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
- Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter or drinking glass to cut dough into 3-inch circles, then place on the prepared baking sheets. Spoon 1 teaspoon poppyseed filling onto the center of each circle. Pinch the sides of each circle to form a triangle, covering as much of the filling as possible. The cookies may be chilled on the baking sheets before baking if desired to help retain their shape.
- Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
