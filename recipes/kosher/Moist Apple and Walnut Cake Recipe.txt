Ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable oil
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 ½ cups apples, peeled and chopped
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 ¼ cups packed brown sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ⅓ cup milk

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
- Sift together flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Add oil, eggs, and vanilla and mix until well combined; batter will be thick. Fold in apples and nuts. Spread batter into the prepared baking dish.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
- Combine brown sugar, butter, and milk in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until glaze is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Pour glaze over hot cake.
