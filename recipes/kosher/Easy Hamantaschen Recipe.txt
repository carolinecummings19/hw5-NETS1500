Ingredients:
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup orange juice
- 2 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 cup fruit preserves, any flavor

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.
- Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder; stir into batter to form a stiff dough, adding more flour if needed.
- Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out into a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter or the rim of a drinking glass; place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
- Spoon about 1 to 2 teaspoons of preserves into center of each cookie. Pinch edges to form three corners.
- Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets for 1 minute; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
