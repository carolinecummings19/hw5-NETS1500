Ingredients:
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water (100 degrees F/40 degrees C)
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 beaten eggs
- 3 Â½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading
- 1 beaten egg yolk, or more if needed

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Place water and yeast in a large bowl; let the mixture stand until a creamy layer forms on top, about 10 minutes. Stir in honey and salt until dissolved, and add beaten eggs. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Mix in flour, a cupful at a time, until dough is sticky. Sprinkle dough with flour, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Form dough into a compact round shape, and place in an oiled bowl. Turn dough over several times in the bowl to oil the surface of the dough, cover the bowl with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm area until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

- Punch down dough, and cut into 3 equal-sized pieces. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Working on a floured surface, roll small dough pieces into ropes about the thickness of your thumb and about 12 inches long. Ropes should be fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right, move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.) Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Take the strand farthest to the left, and move it over the new middle strand. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Continue braiding, alternating sides each time, until the loaf is braided, and pinch the ends together and fold them underneath for a neat look. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Place braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and brush the top with beaten egg yolk. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
- Bake challah in the preheated oven until the top browns to a rich golden color and the loaf sounds hollow when you tap it with a spoon, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before slicing. Jen Causey / Food Styling: Sarah Foley / Prop Styling: Hannah Greenwood
