Ingredients:
- 4 eggs, separated
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 cup honey
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- 3 teaspoons instant coffee granules
- 1 cup hot water

Directions:
- Mix coffee in hot water, and then cool.
- In a large bowl, beat the yolks with the sugar until creamy. Add the oil and then the honey, beating after each addition. Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
