Ingredients:
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3 onions, sliced
- 2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika
- 3 teaspoons salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
- Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in oil until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove onions and set them aside.
- Combine paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Coat beef cubes in spice mixture, and cook in the onion pot until brown on all sides.
- Return onions to the pot with beef; pour in water, tomato paste, garlic, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
