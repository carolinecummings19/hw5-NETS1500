Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon orange juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.
- Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract and orange juice. Gradually stir in flour mixture to form a dough.
- Roll out dough on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut dough into desired holiday shapes with cookie cutters, dipping the cutters into flour as needed so they don't stick to the dough; place them on the prepared baking sheets.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool briefly on the baking sheets before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.
