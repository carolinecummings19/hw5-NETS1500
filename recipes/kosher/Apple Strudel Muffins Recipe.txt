Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla
- 1 ½ cups chopped apples
- ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease or line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
- Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
- Beat sugar, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in vanilla. Stir in apples, then gradually blend in flour mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
- Make topping: Mix brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over each muffin top.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes before transferring muffins to a wire rack to cool.
