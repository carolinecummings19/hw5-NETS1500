Ingredients:
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil (Optional)
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 head iceberg lettuce - rinsed, dried, and chopped
- 4 boneless chicken breast halves, cooked and shredded
- 3 green onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
- 1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients.
- Make the dressing: Shake oil, vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, and soy sauce together in a small lidded container. Set aside until salad is ready.
- Make the salad: Combine lettuce, chicken, green onions, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Cover and chill for 10 minutes.
- While the salad is chilling, heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Break rice noodles into pieces and fry in the hot skillet in small batches until they begin to puff up, 15 to 25 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
- Remove salad from the refrigerator. Portion into salad bowls, top with fried rice noodles, and drizzle dressing over top.
