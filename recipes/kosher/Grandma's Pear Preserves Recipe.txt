Ingredients:
- 6 cups peeled, cored, and sliced pears
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 (2 ounce) package powdered fruit pectin
- 8 cups white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground allspice, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg, or to taste

Directions:
- Inspect six (½-pint) jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water for 10 minutes. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm, soapy water.
- Meanwhile, combine pears, water, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in pectin, and bring to a full boil. Stir in white sugar; boil and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in brown sugar, allspice, and nutmeg.
- Pack pear preserves into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within ½ inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
- Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes.
- Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.
