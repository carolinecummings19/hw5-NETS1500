Ingredients:
- 1 cup margarine
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup instant hot chocolate mix
- ¼ cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
- Beat the margarine and 1 package of cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in the flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and vanilla. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Mix 1 package of cream cheese with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, cinnamon, hot chocolate mix, and chocolate chips. Set aside.
- Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
- Divide dough into four equal portions. Roll each portion of dough into a 10 to 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Spread a thin layer of the chocolate filling on each circle. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll each wedge, starting with the wide end. Place the cookie point-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
