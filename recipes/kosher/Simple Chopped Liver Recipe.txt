Ingredients:
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons canola oil or butter
- salt to taste
- 1 pound calf or chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 1 pinch white sugar

Directions:
- Place eggs into a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then remove the from heat and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
- Meanwhile, heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until onions are very tender and golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. Transfer to a plate.
- Cook chicken livers in the same skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. Place chicken livers onto the same plate as onions and allow to cool.
- Process chicken livers and onions in a food processor to the desired consistency. Transfer to a bowl, season with salt and sugar, and stir in chopped eggs. Chill before serving, about 2 hours.
