Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons sea salt
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 3 shallots, chopped
- ¼ cup unsalted margarine
- 1 ½ cups Worcestershire sauce (such as Lea & Perrins), divided
- 1 (5 pound) beef brisket
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth (such as Progresso)
- 2 cups red wine
- ½ cup water
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (such as Lea & Perrins)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted margarine, thinly sliced

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Combine paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, sea salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; set spice mixture aside.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and shallots; cook and stir until mushrooms release their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Set mushroom mixture aside.
- Melt 1/4 cup margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce. Thoroughly rub beef brisket with spice mixture; place brisket into skillet.
- Brown brisket well on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Pour about 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce into skillet at a time as sauce cooks into brisket, until 1 1/2 cups Worcestershire sauce has been added.
- Place a rack into a heavy Dutch oven; place brisket onto rack. Pour in Worcestershire sauce pan drippings, beef broth, red wine, water, and garlic; top with reserved mushroom mixture. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce over mushrooms and top with remaining 2 tablespoons margarine. Cover the Dutch oven.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C); bake 1 hour more. Reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees F (105 degrees C); bake 1 hour more. Baste with pan drippings every hour.
- Let brisket rest for about 20 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain. Serve with pan gravy.
