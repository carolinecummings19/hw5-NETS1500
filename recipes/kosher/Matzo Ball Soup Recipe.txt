- To make the chicken soup: Place chicken into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until chicken meat is very tender and falling off the bones, about 1 ½ hours. Morgan Hunt Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Hannah Greenwood
- Remove chicken from the pot and place on a cutting board until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Pull chicken meat from the bones, and shred. Discard skin and bones. Morgan Hunt Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Hannah Greenwood
- Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large soup pot. Stir in shredded chicken, carrots, celery, turnip, parsnips, onion, leek, and dill. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Morgan Hunt Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Hannah Greenwood
- Meanwhile, make the matzo balls: Stir matzo ball mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl. Use wet hands (to prevent sticking) and form the mixture into 1-inch balls. Morgan Hunt Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Hannah Greenwood
- Return the broth to a boil. Gently drop matzo balls into the boiling broth. Reduce the heat again and simmer until matzo balls have increased in size and are cooked through, about 20 more minutes. Morgan Hunt Glaze / Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall / Prop Stylist: Hannah Greenwood
