- Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and bones. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
