Ingredients:
- 4 bone-in lamb steaks
- Â¼ cup olive oil
- 4 large cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Place lamb steaks in a single layer in a shallow dish. Cover with olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Flip steaks to coat both sides. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes.
- Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Cook steaks on the preheated grill until nicely browned on the outside and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
