Ingredients:
- 4 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 4 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
- Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in a large bowl. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt together; add to dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then mix in enough flour by hand to make a moderately stiff dough.
- Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
- Cut into 12 portions and shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.
- Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Add in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- When bagels have risen, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water and cook for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain.
- Place drained bagels on a greased baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and eat hot or cold.
