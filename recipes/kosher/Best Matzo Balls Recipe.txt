Ingredients:
- 4 large eggs
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- ⅓ cup club soda
- 2 tablespoons club soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups matzo meal, or more as needed
- 4 quarts water

Directions:
- Whisk eggs and olive oil in a bowl until combined; stir both amounts of club soda and salt into egg mixture. Mix matzo meal into wet ingredients to form a workable dough; if mixture is too wet, stir in 1/4 cup more matzo meal. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
- Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Wet your hands and form matzo ball dough into walnut-size balls. Gently place matzo balls into boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer matzo balls until tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
