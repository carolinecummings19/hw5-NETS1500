Ingredients:
- 1 cup warm water
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 ½ teaspoons salt
- 4 cups bread flour
- 2 ¼ teaspoons bread machine yeast
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon water

Directions:
- Place warm water, sugar, oil, eggs, honey, salt, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow the order recommended by the manufacturer if different. Select Dough cycle; press Start.
- Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done and place on a lightly floured board. Punch dough down and let rest for 5 minutes.
- Meanwhile, grease a baking tray.
- Divide dough in half, then divide each half into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into ropes, about 12- to 14-inches long. Braid 3 ropes into a loaf to form 2 loaves. Gently place loaves onto the prepared baking tray. Mist loaves with water and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Make egg wash: Beat together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined.
- Brush the top and sides of loaves with egg wash.
- Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes. If loaves begin to brown too soon, cover them loosely with aluminum foil.
