Ingredients:
- 6 (6 ounce) halibut fillets
- 1 tablespoon dried dill weed
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- Â¼ teaspoon paprika
- 1 pinch seasoned salt, or more to taste
- 1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut six squares of aluminum foil large enough for each fillet.
- Center each fillet on a foil square. Season with dill, onion powder, parsley, paprika, seasoned salt, lemon-pepper seasoning, and garlic powder, then sprinkle with lemon juice. Fold the foil squares around the fillets to make pockets. Fold the edges to seal. Place sealed packets onto a baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
