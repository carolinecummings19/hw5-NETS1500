Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups mashed overripe bananas
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
- Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl.
- Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl. Stir in bananas, eggs, and walnuts until well blended.
- Pour wet ingredients into flour mixture and stir just until blended. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a paring knife inserted into the crown of each loaf comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and let loaves cool in the pans for at least 5 minutes. Turn out onto a cooling rack, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
- Slice and serve. For more intense flavor, wrap each loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Josie Rivera-Abdo
