Ingredients:
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 1/4 cups softened unsalted butter, divided
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ cup chopped pecans
- ½ cup raisins (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons orange marmalade (Optional)
- 1 large egg white
- 2 tablespoons water

Directions:
- Combine cottage cheese and 1 cup of butter in a bowl. Mix thoroughly. Gradually stir in flour. Dough will be sticky. Divide dough into thirds, roll into balls, wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
- Combine remaining 1/4 cup butter with brown sugar, cinnamon, pecans, and raisins. Set aside. Roll one dough ball into a 9-inch circle on a floured surface. Keep remaining dough refrigerated.
- Spread 1 tablespoon of orange marmalade over circle. Gently press 1/3 of the nut mixture into dough. Cut circle into 16 wedges. Roll each wedge tightly, starting with wide end. Place cookie, point-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Beat egg white with water in a small bowl. Brush onto each cookie.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
