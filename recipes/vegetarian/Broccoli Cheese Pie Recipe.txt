Ingredients:
- 1 head fresh broccoli, chopped
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 onion, chopped
- ¼ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup half-and-half cream
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Bring about 1 inch water to a boil in a pot. Place broccoli in a steamer basket over boiling water and steam until tender but still a bit firm, about 5 minutes.
- In a bowl, mix Cheddar cheese, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and mustard. Mix in 1/4 cup melted butter until evenly moist. Press into the bottom and sides of an 8-inch pie dish.
- Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and mushrooms and sauté until tender. Stir in 2 tablespoons flour, half-and-half, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and mix in steamed broccoli. Gradually stir in eggs. Transfer to the pie crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
