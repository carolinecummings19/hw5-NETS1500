Ingredients:
- 1 (16 ounce) package prepared polenta
- nonstick olive oil cooking spray
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Slice polenta into long, thin slices resembling french fries.
- Spray the bottom of the basket with cooking spray. Place 1/2 of the polenta fries in the basket and lightly mist the tops with cooking spray. Season with salt and pepper.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 10 minutes. Flip the fries with a spatula and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer fries to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining half of fries.
