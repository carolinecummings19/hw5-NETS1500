Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ⅓ cup minced onion
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
- 3 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced
- 1 bunch kale, chopped
- 12 ounces vegan sausage, cut into 1/4 inch slices
- 1 teaspoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pint half-and-half

Directions:
- Heat oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add broth and potatoes; bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, until potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a knife, 10 to 12 minutes. Add kale, sausage, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until 1/2 of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.
- Stir in half-and-half; cover and simmer until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
