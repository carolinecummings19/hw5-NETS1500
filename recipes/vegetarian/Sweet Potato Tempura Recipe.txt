Ingredients:
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup ice water
- 3 tablespoons ice water
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups oil for frying
- 1 large sweet potato, scrubbed and sliced into 1/8-inch slices
- ¼ cup rice wine
- ¼ cup soy sauce

Directions:
- Make the tempura: Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons ice water, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, and salt until just incorporated; batter should still be very lumpy.
- Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a wire rack over several layers of paper towels.
- Dry sweet potato slices with paper towels. Dip three slices into batter, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Fry in the preheated oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sweet potatoes to the wire rack. Repeat to dip and fry remaining sweet potatoes.
- Make the dipping sauce: Whisk rice wine and soy sauce together in a small bowl. Serve with tempura.
