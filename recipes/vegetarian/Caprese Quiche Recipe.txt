Ingredients:
- 1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 8 large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon lemon juice
- 10 leaves chopped fresh basil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 1 (12 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pie crust in a pie pan or baking dish.
- Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
- Spread mozzarella cheese and tomatoes over the bottom of pie crust. Whisk eggs, lemon juice, basil, salt, black pepper, and caramelized onion in a large bowl; pour mixture over cheese and tomatoes.
- Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and crust is flaky, 30 to 40 minutes.
