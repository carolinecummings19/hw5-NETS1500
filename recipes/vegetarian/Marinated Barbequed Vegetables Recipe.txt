Ingredients:
- 1 small eggplant, cut into 3/4 inch thick slices
- 2 small red bell peppers, seeded and cut into wide strips
- 3 zucchinis, sliced
- 6 fresh mushrooms, stems removed
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh basil
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

Directions:
- Place eggplant, bell peppers, zucchinis, and mushrooms into a large bowl.
- Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, basil, and garlic in a medium bowl until well combined. Pour mixture over vegetables; toss to coat. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
- Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Place vegetables on skewers or directly on the preheated grill. Cook, brushing frequently with marinade, until desired doneness is reached, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
