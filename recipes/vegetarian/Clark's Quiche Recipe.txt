- 8 ounces thick-sliced bacon
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, finely diced
- 2 cups finely diced smoked ham
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (9-inch) unbaked pie crusts
- 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded

- 1 ½ cups half-and-half
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
