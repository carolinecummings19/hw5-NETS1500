Ingredients:
- 24 (3 inch) frozen tart shells, thawed
- 6 slices bacon, or more to taste
- 1 ¼ cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided (Optional)
- 2 green onions, diced
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 4 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange tart shells in two 12-cup muffin tins; line each shell with a layer of pie weights or dried beans.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust edges are lightly browned and shells are about 3/4 fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit until needed.
- While the shells are baking, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and crumble when cooled.
- Mix 1 cup Swiss, green onions, and crumbled bacon together in a bowl; divide mixture evenly among tart shells.
- Whisk milk, eggs, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Ladle egg mixture into each tart shell until about 2/3 full. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Swiss over tarts.
- Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle and shells are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Unknown
