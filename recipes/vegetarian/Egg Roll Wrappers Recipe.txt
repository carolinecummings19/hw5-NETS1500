Ingredients:
- ¾ cup cold water
- 1 large egg, beaten
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅞ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided

Directions:
- Whisk cold water, egg, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add flour in 3 batches, mixing well after each addition. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.
- Heat a wok over high heat. Remove from the heat and thinly coat with 1 tablespoon peanut oil. Return to the heat and reduce the temperature to low.
- Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the warm wok to make an 8-inch diameter circle. Rotate the wok quickly to spread batter into an even layer. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and the edges begin to curl, 45 to 60 seconds. Carefully remove from the wok and place onto a paper towel with the browned side down. Repeat to make one more wrapper.
- Rub the wok with remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut oil, then make remaining two wrappers as directed above.
- When wrappers have cooled completely, cut each one in half to yield eight wrappers.
