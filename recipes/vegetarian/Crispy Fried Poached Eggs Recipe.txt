Ingredients:
- 4 large fresh eggs
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 4 cups vegetable oil
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped pickled red onions (for garnish)
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onions (for garnish)
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes for garnish, or to taste

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over medium heat. Stir in vinegar and bring to a gentle, slow simmer. Working with one egg at a time, crack an egg into a ramekin or measuring cup for easier transfer. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Stir the water vigorously to create a whirlpool effect. As the whirlpool is turning, drop the egg into the center of the water. Continue to stir gently, cooking until the egg white turns opaque. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the egg from the water and move to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. In a medium saucepan, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Meanwhile, set up a dredging station with 3 separate bowls. To the first bowl, add the flour. Beat 2 eggs with salt and pepper in a second bowl. Add breadcrumbs to the third bowl. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Carefully dip the cooled egg first into the flour, second into the egg mixture, and last into the breadcrumbs, coating egg on all sides at each station. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Using a slotted spoon, carefully drop the egg into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
- Garnish with pickled red onions, green onions, and red pepper flakes. Serve immediately. Allrecipes/Diana Chistruga
