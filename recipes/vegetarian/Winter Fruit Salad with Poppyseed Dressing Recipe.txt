Ingredients:
- ½ cup white sugar

- 1 head romaine lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces
- 4 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
- 1 cup cashews
- ¼ cup dried cranberries
- 1 apple - peeled, cored and diced
- 1 pear - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
- Combine sugar, lemon juice, onion, mustard, and salt in a food processor or blender; process until well blended. With machine still running, add oil in a slow, steady stream until mixture is thick and smooth. Add poppy seeds, and process just a few seconds more to mix.
