Ingredients:
- 4 large portobello mushrooms
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- ½ cup PHILADELPHIA Herb & Garlic Cooking Creme
- ½ cup grape tomatoes, quartered
- 2 tablespoons Kraft 100% Parmesan Shredded Cheese
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
- Preheat the grill to medium heat and grease the grates. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- Discard stems from mushrooms; scrape out gills with a small spoon. Brush mushrooms with olive oil.
- Cook mushrooms on the preheated grill until slightly softened, about 2 minutes per side.
- Remove mushrooms from the grill and place on the prepared baking sheet. Dab the insides of mushroom caps with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Fill caps with cooking creme, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, and green onion.
- Place the tray with stuffed mushrooms on the preheated grill. Cover and cook until filling is heated through, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve warm.
