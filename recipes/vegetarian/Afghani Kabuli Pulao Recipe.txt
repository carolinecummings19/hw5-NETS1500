Ingredients:
- 1 onion, peeled and halved
- 1 whole head garlic, loose skins removed
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 cardamom pods, crushed
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cumin seed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 4 whole cloves
- 3 ½ cups water, or as needed to cover
- 2 cups sella basmati rice
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup matchstick carrots
- ½ cup raisins
- ½ cup slivered almonds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seed
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cardamom pod, shell removed and seeds crushed into a powder
- 1 whole clove

Directions:
- Make the broth: Place halved onion, garlic head, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, pepper, cumin seed, salt, sugar, paprika, coriander seeds, and cloves into a pressure cooker. Pour in water to cover.
- Close the cooker securely and place the pressure regulator over the vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Set to high and heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Unlock the lid and remove.
- When the broth is almost finished, start the rice: Soak rice in cool water for 5 minutes, then rinse until water runs clear.
- Strain cooled broth into a bowl. Clean out the pressure cooker, then place over medium heat and add oil.
- Add onion and garlic to the cooker; cook and stir until softened and browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in carrots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes more. Add strained rice, raisins, almonds, cumin seed, pepper, cardamom powder, and clove. Stir to combine, then pour in enough broth to cover.
- Close the cooker securely and seal the vent; set to high and heat until the first whistle, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for 7 minutes, then let pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer cooked rice to a serving dish to prevent overcooking.
