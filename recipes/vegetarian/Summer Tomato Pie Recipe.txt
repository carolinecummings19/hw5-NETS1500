Ingredients:
- 1 9-inch pie pastry
- 3 tomatoes, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup mayonnaise

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press pie pastry into a 9-inch pie pan; prick the bottom and sides with a fork.
- Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely; reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- While the crust is cooling, place tomato slices in a single layer in a colander; sprinkle with salt. Let sit for about 10 minutes to release moisture. Blot excess moisture with a paper towel.
- Arrange 1/2 of the tomatoes in a layer over the bottom of the cooled crust, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle with 1/2 each of the garlic, basil, Cheddar, and mozzarella. Repeat layers once more, then spread mayonnaise over the top.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
