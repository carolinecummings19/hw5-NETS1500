Ingredients:
- 2 pounds Granny Smith apples
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
- Peel and slice apples. Toss with sugars, cinnamon and flour. Set aside.
- Roll crust to make slightly larger to fit 10-inch glass pie pan. Fit bottom crust in pie pan. Turn in apple mixture and dot with butter. Put crust on top and crimp edges of crust together.
- Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
- Wet hands with water and dampen top of pie. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Puncture top of pie with fork so the steam can escape.
- Bake for 15 minutes in preheated oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for about 45 minutes more, until crust is golden brown. It's a good practice to place a piece of aluminum foil slightly larger than the pie under the pie plate to catch overflows. Serve warm.
