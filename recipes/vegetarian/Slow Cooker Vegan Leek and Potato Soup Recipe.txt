Ingredients:
- ¼ cup vegan butter
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 large leeks, diced
- 1 yellow onion, minced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1 cup minced Pleurotus mushrooms (oyster mushrooms)
- 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 cup unsweetened oat milk, divided
- 1 tablespoon potato starch
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Turn on the Sauté function on your slow cooker. Heat vegan butter and olive oil in the slow cooker. Add leeks, onion, carrot, and mushrooms. Cook and stir until leeks and onions are translucent and softened, carrots have softened, and mushrooms have liquefied, about 7 minutes. Add potatoes and vegetable broth; mix well. Mix 1 tablespoon oat milk with potato starch in a small bowl to create a slurry and stir it into soup.
- Place remaining oat milk in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave until hot, about 30 seconds. Pour into soup and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the Sauté function.
- Cook on Low for 6 hours or High for 3 1/2 hours. Stir soup before serving.
