Ingredients:
- 3 cups frozen bite-sized potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¾ cup diced ham
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 eggs
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- ⅓ cup diced onion
- ⅓ cup diced green bell pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Make the crust: Place potato nuggets in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until thawed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and salt; mash together until potato nuggets are crumbled. Press evenly into a glass pie dish.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
- Remove crust from the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ham, Parmesan cheese, and flour in a bowl.
- Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in milk, onion, bell pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Pour into Cheddar mixture and stir filling until well combined. Pour filling over crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and golden, about 45 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
