Ingredients:
- 1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust
- 1 pound small fresh button mushrooms
- 1 pound ground pork breakfast sausage
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup half-and-half
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon salt

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Place pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate; set aside. Snip off mushroom stems; cut large mushrooms in half.
- Crumble sausage into a large skillet; add mushrooms. Cook on medium-high heat until sausage is browned and all liquid from mushrooms has evaporated. Drain and discard grease. Stir parsley into sausage mixture.
- Beat eggs in a large bowl; whisk in half-and-half, Parmesan cheese, and salt; stir in sausage mixture until well blended. Pour egg mixture into the prepared pie crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust is well browned and the filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand briefly before serving.
