Ingredients:
- dough for a (9-inch) deep-dish pie crust
- 8 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ½ cup chopped leeks (white and pale green parts only)
- ½ cup chopped onion
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 3 large eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 6 ounces shredded Gruyère cheese

Directions:
- Roll pie dough to fit a (9-inch) deep-dish pie plate. Press into the pie plate and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before baking.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- Line chilled pie crust with foil and fill halfway with dried beans, rice, or baking weights. Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue to bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
- While the pie crust is baking, cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pan to drain. Blot out some of the oil from the skillet, leaving 1 to 2 teaspoons. Add leeks, onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir until tender and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
- Remove the pie crust from the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Whisk eggs and egg yolks together with cream and milk in a large bowl. Add thyme and stir to combine.
- Sprinkle 2/3 of the leek mixture over the bottom of the baked crust. Top with 1/3 of the cooked bacon and 2/3 of the Gruyère. Carefully ladle in egg mixture, then sprinkle with remaining leek mixture, bacon, and Gruyère.
- Bake in the preheated oven until browned, set, and no longer jiggly in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
