Ingredients:
- 2 cups shredded potatoes
- ¼ cup grated onion
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 head cauliflower, coarsely chopped
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ teaspoon paprika

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a shallow 9-inch baking dish or pie pan.
- To make crust: Use a cheesecloth to squeeze extra liquid from grated potatoes. In a medium size mixing bowl, combine potatos, onion, egg, salt, and flour. Transfer mixture to the prepared pie pan, and pat it down with a rubber spatula or your fingertips. Bake for 30 minutes. Brush crust with oil, and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven, and reduce the oven's temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Meanwhile, make the filling: In a large frying pan over high heat, heat oil until hot. Reduce the temperature to medium and sauté onion, garlic, basil, thyme, salt, pepper, and paprika in the hot oil; cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir cauliflower into the pan and cook for 15 minutes.
- Spread 1/2 of the cheese onto potato crust. Spoon vegetable mixture on top of the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the sautéed vegetables. Beat milk and eggs together in a small bowl, and then pour over vegetables and cheese. Sprinkle paprika over mixture.
- Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top of the pie is slightly browned.
