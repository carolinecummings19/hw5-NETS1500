Ingredients:
- 10 carrots, ends trimmed to make hot dog shape
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- ¼ cup sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, cover, and steam until crisp-tender, about 15 minutes. Run cold water over carrots to stop the cooking process. Transfer carrots to a storage container.
- Whisk soy sauce, water, vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over carrots. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or longer for a more intense flavor.
- When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove carrots from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
- Cook carrots on the preheated grill until the desired doneness is reached, 5 to 10 minutes.
