Ingredients:
- 4 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
- 6 ounces oyster mushrooms, large stems removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided, plus more to taste
- 1/4 cup unsweetened plant milk
- 3/4 cup finely ground cornmeal
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup purchased remoulade sauce
- 4 hoagie buns, split and toasted, if desired
- 1 large tomato, cut into 8 slices
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- lemon wedges, for serving

Directions:
- Pour oil to a depth of 1 inch in a large deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or pot (preferably cast-iron) or a deep fryer; heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Youâ€™ll need about 4 cups oil.
- Toss together mushrooms, 1 tablespoon oil, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Let stand 15 minutes. Add plant milk; toss to coat.
- Meanwhile, whisk together cornmeal, flour, Cajun seasoning, black pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a shallow dish.
- Working in batches, dredge mushrooms in cornmeal mixture, shaking off excess. Transfer to a wire rack.
- Working in batches, fry mushrooms until deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. If you like, sprinkle mushrooms with additional salt.
- Spread remoulade sauce on hoagie buns. Top with tomato, lettuce, and mushrooms. Serve with lemon wedges. Cook's Notes: Vegan-ize: Replace purchased remoulade sauce with a vegan version: Whisk together 1/3 cup vegan mayonnaise; 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard; 1 tablespoon ketchup; 1 teaspoon each minced garlic, less-sodium soy sauce, and lemon juice; 1/2 teaspoon prepared horseradish; and 1/2 teaspoon paprika, in a small bowl. Makes 1/2 cup. Make it Meaty: Substitute 16 ounces shucked, well-drained oysters for the mushrooms. Soak oysters in 1 cup milk 15 minutes (omitting oil, lemon juice, and salt in Step 2); drain. Increase salt in Step 3 to 1/2 teaspoon. Dredge, fry, and serve as directed. From the Editor: Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of breading ingredients.
