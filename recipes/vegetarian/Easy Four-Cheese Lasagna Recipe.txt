Ingredients:
- 16 ounces uncooked lasagna noodles
- 1 (26 ounce) can spaghetti sauce
- 1 pound cottage cheese
- 8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
- 8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
- Meanwhile, blend tomato sauce and cottage cheese together in a blender or with an electric mixer until smooth.
- Spoon a little sauce mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked noodles over the sauce, then sprinkle a portion of the mozzarella, Cheddar, and Parmesan over top. Repeat layering of sauce, noodles, and cheeses, finishing with a cheese layer.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden, 30 to 45 minutes.
