Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup chopped carrot
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian burger crumbles
- ½ cup cooked green lentils
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ¾ cups vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 cup frozen peas
- ½ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cups prepared mashed potatoes

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large casserole dish.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrot, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until soft and onion is clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Add burger crumbles and lentils; cook until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Add flour and saute, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Stir broth, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and soy sauce into the skillet. Simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in peas and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish and top with mashed potatoes.
- Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and potatoes are golden, 20 to 30 minutes.
