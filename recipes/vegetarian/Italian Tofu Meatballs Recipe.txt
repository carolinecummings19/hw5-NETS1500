Ingredients:
- 1 (14 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 egg
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram
- 1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
- 1 ¼ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon hot sauce
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- ¼ cup olive oil

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 15 minutes to drain excess water. Break tofu into small pieces and squeeze again to remove as much water as possible.
- Place tofu in a large bowl. Add onion, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, basil, marjoram, rosemary, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, hot sauce, and garlic; mix well with your hands until thoroughly combined.
- Drizzle some olive oil on the lined baking sheet. Form tablespoonfuls of tofu mixture into balls and arrange in rows on the baking sheet. Drizzle remaining olive oil over meatballs.
- Bake in the preheated oven until browned and firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.
