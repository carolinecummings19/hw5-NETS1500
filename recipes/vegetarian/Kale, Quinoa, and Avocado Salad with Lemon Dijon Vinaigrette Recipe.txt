Ingredients:
- 1 ⅓ cups water
- ⅔ cup quinoa
- 1 bunch kale, torn into bite-sized pieces
- ½ avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced
- ½ cup chopped cucumber

- 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
- 1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Bring 1 1/3 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa tender and water absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
- Place a steamer basket into a saucepan with 1 inch water; bring water to a boil. Add kale, cover, and steam until hot, about 45 seconds; transfer to a large plate. Top kale with quinoa, avocado, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and feta cheese.
