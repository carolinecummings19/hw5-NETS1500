- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds

- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
- Lay 1 sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and cut in half lengthwise. Roll 1 half out with a rolling pin so it is wide enough to fold twice lengthwise. Mix egg and milk together in a small bowl. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Spread 1/6 of the spinach mixture lengthwise in the center of puff pastry. Roll one side over the filling and brush other side with egg mixture. Roll over again to seal. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Brush top of roll with egg mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cut roll into 6 equal-sized rolls. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry. Place cut rolls onto the prepared baking sheets. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Bake in the preheated oven until spinach rolls are puffed up and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
