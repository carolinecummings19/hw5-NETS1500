Ingredients:
- 5 large eggs, beaten
- 2 cups milk
- 1 (8 ounce) jar chunky salsa
- ½ green bell pepper, chopped
- ½ onion, chopped
- 1 (16 ounce) package shredded Mexican-style cheese blend
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
- 1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Whisk together eggs, milk, salsa, bell pepper, onion, and cheese in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning.
- Spread meat mixture into pie crust placed in a 9-inch pie dish. Pour egg mixture over beef.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes before serving warm.
