Ingredients:
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 medium head cabbage

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
- Remove any loose outer leaves from the cabbage. Trim the stem so the cabbage sits flat on a cutting board. Cut vertically into six 3/4-inch-thick "steaks". Place the steaks on a baking sheet.
- Brush one side of the steaks with some of the oil mixture.
- Place the steaks on the grill, oiled-side down; close the lid and grill for 5 minutes. Brush more oil mixture on top and gently flip over; close lid and grill until tender-crisp and slightly charred, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove to a platter and drizzle with any remaining oil mixture.
