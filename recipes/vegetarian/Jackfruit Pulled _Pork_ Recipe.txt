Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup chopped Vidalia onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 pounds young green jackfruit packed in water, drained
- 2 cups barbecue sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add jackfruit; cook and stir until lightly browned and relatively free of moisture, about 10 minutes.
- Transfer jackfruit mixture to a slow cooker and cover with barbecue sauce. Cover and cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until jackfruit shreds easily with a fork, about 6 hours.
