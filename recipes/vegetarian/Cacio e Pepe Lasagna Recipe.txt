Ingredients:
- olive oil, divided
- 12 lasagna noodles, broken into 2-inch pieces
- 1 (16 ounce) container fresh ricotta cheese
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided
- 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste
- 1 pinch paprika for garnish (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease four 8-ounce ramekins with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
- Mix together drained noodles, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a bowl. Divide mixture among the ramekins. Top with 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese, drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown in spots and lasagna is heated through, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and paprika, if desired.
