Ingredients:
- 6 1/4 cups vegetable broth, or more if needed
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 large onion, diced
- ½ cup barley
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup vegetable shortening (such as Crisco)

Directions:
- Combine 6 cups vegetable broth, frozen vegetables, tomatoes with juice, potatoes, onion, barley, garlic, parsley, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and bay leaf in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low for 5 to 6 hours.
- Place flour in a large bowl; cut shortening into flour using a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add remaining 1/4 cup vegetable broth; stir with a fork until dough no longer sticks onto the sides of the bowl. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; roll out 1/8 inch thick. Cut dough into strips or small squares. Add to the slow cooker; cook until dumplings are soft and cooked in the middle, about 1 hour. Unknown
