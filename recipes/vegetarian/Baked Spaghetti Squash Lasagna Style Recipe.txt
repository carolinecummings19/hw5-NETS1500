Ingredients:
- 1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 (14 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 cube vegetable bouillon
- black pepper to taste
- 1 (15 ounce) can black olives, chopped
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Spray a baking sheet with a thin layer of cooking spray. Place squash halves cut-side down on the baking sheet.
- Bake squash in the preheated oven until a knife can be easily inserted, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
- Grease a nonstick saucepan with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Saut√© onion and garlic until golden brown. Stir in tomatoes, basil, bouillon cube, and black pepper. Cook until thickened, about 15 minutes.
- Remove squash strands with a fork, reserving shells. Layer each half with a spoonful of sauce, a layer of spaghetti squash strands, olives, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers until shells are full or until all ingredients are used. Top with Parmesan cheese.
- Bake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese melts, about 20 minutes.
