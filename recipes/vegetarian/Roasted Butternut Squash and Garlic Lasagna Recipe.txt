Ingredients:
- 3 pounds butternut squash, halved and seeded
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 quart milk
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 9 no-cook lasagna noodles
- 1 ⅓ cups finely grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
- Brush butternut squash halves with vegetable oil and season with salt.
- Roast in the preheated oven until golden and easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then scoop flesh into a bowl. Set aside.
- Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot butter until softened. Stir in flour and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until smooth. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in butternut squash flesh and season with salt and pepper. Butternut sauce can be made 3 days ahead and refrigerated.
- Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
- Beat heavy cream in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until foamy. Gradually season with salt, continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift the beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak should curl over slightly. Set aside.
- Pour 1 cup butternut sauce into the prepared baking dish and place 3 lasagna noodles on top in a single layer. Spread 1/2 of remaining sauce over noodles and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover with another layer of noodles, spread remaining sauce on top, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Place final layer of noodles on top. Spread whipped cream over noodles, making sure pasta is completely covered. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.
- Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is bubbly and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
