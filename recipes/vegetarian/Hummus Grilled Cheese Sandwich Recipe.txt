Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- ½ cup coarsely chopped sweet onion
- 4 slices bread
- 4 teaspoons mayonnaise
- ⅔ cup roasted red pepper hummus, such as ATHENOS®
- ½ cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
- Melt butter over medium heat in a skillet. Sauté mushrooms and onions until tender, about 5 minutes; remove from skillet, and set skillet aside.
- Spread mayonnaise on 4 slices of bread. Turn the slices mayo side down, and evenly spread hummus on all 4 slices. On only 2 of those slices, evenly layer mushroom-onion mixture followed by Swiss cheese. Top with remaining 2 bread slices with mayonnaise side up. (To clarify, each of the 2 sandwiches will have hummus on the top and bottom of the sandwich, with cheese and mushroom mixture in the center).
- Reheat the skillet over medium heat; place sandwiches mayonnaise side down in the skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides and cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping half way through.
