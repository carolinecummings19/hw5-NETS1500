Ingredients:
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 6 portobello mushroom caps
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 6 kaiser rolls, split, toasted
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed
- 6 leaves lettuce
- 6 tomato slices

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Whisk vinegar, oil, and garlic together in a small bowl.
- Arrange mushrooms on a baking sheet with the gills facing up; brush with about 2/3 of the marinade and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
- Transfer mushrooms to the preheated grill with the gills facing down; grill, basting occasionally with remaining marinade, until tender, about 4 minutes per side.
- While the mushrooms are cooking, mix mayonnaise, basil, Dijon, and lemon juice together in a small bowl. Butter toasted rolls, then spread with mayonnaise mixture.
- Remove mushrooms from the grill and place on bottom buns. Top with lettuce, tomatoes, and top buns.
