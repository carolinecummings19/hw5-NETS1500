Ingredients:
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shortening
- 1 ¼ cups ice water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 carrots, thinly sliced
- 1 turnip, peeled and diced
- 2 potatoes, peeled and diced
- ½ pound mushrooms, chopped
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 cube vegetable bouillon
- 1 teaspoon dried tarragon
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 eggs, beaten

Directions:
- In a large bowl, mix together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Divide dough into 8 pieces, and shape into balls. Cover, and set aside.
- Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrot, turnip, potatoes and mushrooms. Add water, bouillon cube, tarragon, salt and pepper. Cook for 15 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Roll each pastry ball into a circle, 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Place about 1 cup of filling on one half of each circle. Fold pastry over filling, and pinch edges to seal. Place on baking sheet, and brush with egg.
- Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
