Ingredients:
- 2 large eggs
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 quart water
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 1 ½ cups dried bread crumbs
- 2 cups olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
- Whisk together eggs, cheese, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator while you prepare rice.
- Pour water and remaining 1 teaspoon salt into a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir in rice and reduce heat to low. Cook rice, stirring frequently, until water is almost completely absorbed. Remove from heat and slowly pour in egg mixture, stirring rapidly to prevent egg from scrambling. Allow rice mixture to cool at room temperature for 1 hour.
- Pour bread crumbs into a pile on one end of a cutting board. Dampen hands and roll rice mixture into 1-inch balls, then coat each one with bread crumbs.
- Heat 1 inch oil in a deep saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Working in batches, fry rice balls in hot oil, turning as needed to ensure even browning. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
