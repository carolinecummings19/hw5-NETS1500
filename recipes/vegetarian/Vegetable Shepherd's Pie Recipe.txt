Ingredients:
- 8 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
- 3 tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 (19 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ teaspoon paprika

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash; set aside.
- While potatoes are cooking, steam or boil carrots and mixed vegetables until near tender. Drain and set aside.
- Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic powder, basil, and parsley in hot butter for about 20 seconds. Stir into mashed potatoes in the pot; season with salt and pepper. Gradually beat in milk until potatoes are light and fluffy; add more milk to reach desired consistency. Set aside.
- Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until tender but not brown. Stir in kidney beans, tomatoes, tomato sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and carrot-vegetable mixture. Cook until heated through and bubbly.
- Transfer mixture to an 8x8-inch baking dish. Drop mashed potatoes in mounds over the top. Sprinkle with cheese and paprika.
- Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
