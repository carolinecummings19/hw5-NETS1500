Ingredients:
- 1 pastry for double-crust pie
- ⅓ cup butter
- ½ cup thinly sliced onion
- 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
- ⅓ (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup cubed red potatoes
- ½ teaspoon oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 ½ cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 1 crust into a 9-inch pie plate; chill until ready to use.
- Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, tofu, and garlic; cook until onion is tender and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with oregano, salt, and black pepper; stir in flour until vegetable mixture coated.
- Slowly stir milk into vegetable mixture; cook until begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth; cook until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes more. Stir in frozen vegetables.
- Pour filling into crust; top with remaining pie crust, crimping edges together to seal. Poke ventilation holes in top crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool before serving for 10 to 15 minutes.
