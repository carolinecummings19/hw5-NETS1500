Ingredients:
- 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2 tablespoons salt for boiling water, plus more to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
- Add peeled and quartered potatoes to a sauce pan. Cover with cold water by at least 1 inch. Season with salt and garlic, and bring to a boil on medium-high heat.
- Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until potatoes are very soft, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add back into the pot or into a bowl.
- Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until very smooth. Switch to a whisk or electric hand mixer, and whip in the olive oil in two additions.
- Season to taste with salt; serve with more olive oil drizzled over the top if desired. John Mitzewich Chef's Notes: A mild, buttery olive oil is the best choice for this recipe, rather than one with a peppery, grassy flavor. You can use Yukon gold potatoes, but the texture will not be as light and fluffy. For more intense garlic flavor, garlic can be finely crushed and added raw to the potatoes when olive oil is added.
