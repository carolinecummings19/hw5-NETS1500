Ingredients:
- ½ sheet puff pastry
- 3 tablespoons butter
- ¼ pound mushrooms, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup crumbled goat cheese
- 4 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking tray.
- Lay puff pastry out on a lightly floured surface and cut into 8 squares. Prick the squares in several places with a fork. Place the puff pastry squares on prepared baking sheet.
- Bake puff pastry squares for 7 minutes. Remove tray from the oven; flatten squares using the backside of a spatula. Return puff pastry to the oven to bake until golden brown, about 5 more minutes.
- Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
- Top baked puff pastry squares evenly with mushroom mixture; crumble goat cheese over mushrooms and sprinkle with parsley. Serve warm.
