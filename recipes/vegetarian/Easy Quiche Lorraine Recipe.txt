Ingredients:
- 1 unbaked 9 inch pie crust
- 6 slices bacon
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups shredded Swiss cheese
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
- Line pie crust with a double layer of aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until crust is just set, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, crumble, and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon grease in the skillet.
- Cook and stir onion in reserved grease in the skillet over medium heat until tender; drain and set aside.
- Mix together milk, eggs, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in bacon and onion. Toss together Swiss cheese and flour in a medium bowl; add to egg mixture and stir well. Pour into par-baked crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cover edges of crust with foil if they begin to get too brown. Let quiche cool for 10 minutes before serving.
