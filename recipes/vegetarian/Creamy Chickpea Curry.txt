Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons mild curry powder
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 ½ cups vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- ¾ pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into ¾ -inch pieces
- 1 large carrot, sliced diagonally ¼-inch thick
- 4 cups large cauliflower florets
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup coconut milk
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish
- ½ cup frozen peas
- salt to taste
- cooked basmati rice to serve
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce to serve

Directions:
- Melt coconut oil in a heavy 4-quart pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ginger and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add curry powder, pepper flakes, broth, soy sauce, maple syrup, and tomato paste; mix well.
- Add potatoes and carrot, cover pot, and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to a simmer and leave lid ajar. Cook just until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add cauliflower, chickpeas, coconut milk, and cilantro. Stir gently to incorporate. Return to simmer with lid ajar and simmer just until cauliflower is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Fold in peas and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
- Remove from heat and season with salt, if needed. Serve with steamed basmati rice and, for those who'd like more heat, sriracha sauce. Garnish with cilantro.
