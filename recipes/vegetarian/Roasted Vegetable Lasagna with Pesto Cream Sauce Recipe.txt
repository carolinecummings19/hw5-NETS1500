Ingredients:
- 2 zucchini, sliced lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch-thick pieces
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares
- 2 cups bite-sized broccoli pieces
- 1 ½ cups bite-sized baby carrot pieces
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste (Optional)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 lasagna noodles, or more as needed
- 1 cup Alfredo sauce
- 2 tablespoons pesto, or more to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ⅓ (6 ounce) package fresh spinach
- 1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease or line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Arrange zucchini, bell pepper, broccoli, and carrots in a single layer on the baking sheet. Coat with olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix well.
- Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
- Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with one layer of lasagna noodles.
- Toss the roasted vegetables with Alfredo sauce and pesto until well coated. Spread mixture over the noodles in the dish. Place another layer of noodles over the vegetables.
- Mix ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and spinach together and spread mixture over the noodle layer. Distribute mozzarella cheese evenly over the ricotta layer. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and oregano on top.
- Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 30 to 35 minutes. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes to lightly brown the top layer, if desired.
