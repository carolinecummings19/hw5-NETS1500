Ingredients:
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into large florets
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh mushrooms
- 3 green onions, chopped
- 5 large eggs, or more to taste
- 1 cup half-and-half, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch curry powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch paprika, or to taste (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower; cover and steam until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
- Blend cauliflower, mushrooms, and green onions in a blender under chopped, yet still chunky.
- Separate egg yolks and egg whites into 2 separate bowls. Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until medium peaks form.
- Combine half-and-half, butter, and flour together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until white sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly.
- Stir white sauce, Parmesan cheese, cauliflower mixture, egg yolks, turmeric, salt, pepper, and curry powder together in a bowl; gently fold in egg whites using a spatula or wide knife. Pour egg mixture into a glass baking dish. Sprinkle paprika over egg mixture.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes.
