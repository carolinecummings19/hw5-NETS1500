Ingredients:
- 1 (16 ounce) package whole white button mushrooms
- 2 scallions
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- 1 pinch salt
- cooking spray

Directions:
- Gently clean mushrooms with a damp cloth. Remove and discard stems.
- Mince scallions, separating white and green parts.
- Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
- Mix cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, scallion whites, paprika, and salt together in a small bowl. Stuff mixture into mushrooms, pressing gently with the back of a small spoon to fill each cavity.
- Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and set mushrooms inside without overcrowding; you may need to work in batches.
- Air-fry mushrooms until filling is lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate.
- Sprinkle mushrooms with scallion greens. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
