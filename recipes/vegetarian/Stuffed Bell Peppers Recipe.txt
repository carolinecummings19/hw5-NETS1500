Ingredients:
- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup uncooked white rice
- 4 green bell peppers
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 8 ounces textured vegetable protein
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cups tomato sauce
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
- Combine water and rice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
- Cut tops off peppers and remove seeds. Arrange peppers in a large baking dish. Chop up usable portion of the tops.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté chopped peppers and onion in hot oil until soft. Stir in textured vegetable protein and parsley. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes. Mix in cooked rice and 1 1/4 cups tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture into peppers; top each with remaining tomato sauce.
- Cover and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes. Uncover, top each pepper with mozzarella cheese, and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. Richie
