Ingredients:
- 1 pound sweet potatoes
- 1 large egg
- 1 clove garlic, pressed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg or to taste
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until soft to the touch, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, 15 to 30 minutes.
- Remove and discard skins from cooled potatoes. Mash flesh in a large bowl or press through a ricer. Blend in egg, garlic, salt, and nutmeg. Mix in flour, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
- While the water is coming to a boil, make the gnocchi: Roll dough on a floured surface into several long, snake-like logs. Cut logs into 1-inch pieces.
- Drop dough pieces into boiling water and cook until they float to the surface. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a serving dish and keep warm until ready to serve.
