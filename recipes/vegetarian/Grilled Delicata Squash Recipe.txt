Ingredients:
- 2 large delicata squash
- ⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅓ cup maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese, or to taste

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
- Wash and dry each squash and place on a cutting board. With a sharp knife, slice off the stem end and slice each squash in half, lengthwise. Using a spoon, remove the seeds and membranes. Slice across each squash half to create 1/2-inch pieces and place in a mixing bowl.
- Combine melted butter, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Stir to combine, and pour over squash pieces. Stir squash in the butter mixture until coated.
- Place squash pieces directly on the preheated grill grates and grill 4 to 5 minutes, per side. Move squash away from flare-ups. When grill marks appear and squash is fork-tender, remove from heat and place in a mixing bowl.
- Pour maple syrup over the squash pieces and stir to coat. Place on a serving dish and garnish with feta cheese crumbles, if desired.
