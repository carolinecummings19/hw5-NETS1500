Ingredients:
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers
- 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced
- 1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, crumbled
- 6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- 1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce
- 1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
- 8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.
- Combine beans, garlic, onion, chile peppers, jalapeño pepper, and tempeh in a medium bowl. Pour enchilada sauce into a shallow bowl.
- Dip three tortillas in enchilada sauce, and place them in the prepared baking dish. Be sure to cover bottom of the dish as completely as possible. Place 1/2 of the bean mixture on top of the tortillas, and repeat. Drizzle remaining sauce over the casserole, and sprinkle with olives and shredded cheese.
- Cover, and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbling and the cheese is melted. pinktashy
