Ingredients:
- 4 medium zucchini
- ¾ teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 tablespoons bread crumbs, divided
- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 7 ounces crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
- Grate zucchini using the largest holes of a box grater. Place in a colander, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and let drain for 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, whisk eggs in a large bowl. Whisk in Greek yogurt and 1/3 cup olive oil. Add flour and whisk until well combined.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a 12-inch round baking pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil and sprinkle 1/2 of the bread crumbs over the bottom.
- Place zucchini in a cheesecloth or kitchen towel; bring the ends together and twist to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.
- Transfer zucchini to the bowl with the egg-flour mixture. Add bell pepper, onion, black pepper, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and but 2 tablespoons crumbled feta; mix well. Use a spatula to spread mixture into an even layer in the prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining feta over top, followed by remaining bread crumbs.
- Bake in the preheated oven until pie is set and top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and cool 20 minutes before cutting.
