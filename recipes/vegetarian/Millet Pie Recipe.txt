Ingredients:
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup oats
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 cup millet
- ½ cup diced onion
- ½ cup diced carrot
- ½ cup diced celery
- ½ cup diced potato
- ¼ cup safflower oil
- ¼ cup tamari sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 whole cloves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch double crust pie
- 1 egg, beaten (Optional)

Directions:
- Bring 1 cup water and oats to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until water is absorbed, 10 minutes. Bring 1 1/2 cups water and millet to a boil in a separate saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until water is absorbed and millet is tender, 20 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Combine oats, millet, onion, carrot, celery, potato, safflower oil, tamari, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; mix well.
- Press 1 pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Pour filling into pie crust. Top with second pie crust pastry; pinch edges together. Pierce a few areas of the top crust to allow pie to ventilate during baking. Brush top crust with beaten egg.
- Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes.
