Ingredients:
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 cups chopped cremini mushrooms
- 3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
- 1/3 cup chopped onion
- 2 cups chopped kale leaves
- 4 eggs, lightly beaten
- 4 egg whites, lightly beaten
- 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese with jalape√±os
- 1 (4-ounce) can green chiles, undrained
- 8 (6-inch) whole wheat flour tortillas
- 1/4 cup salsa
- optional toppers: Mexican crema, chopped fresh cilantro, sliced green onions, and/or chopped black olives

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet heat over medium heat. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add kale. Cook and stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from skillet.
- Add eggs and egg whites to the hot skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. With a spatula, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is cooked through but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Return vegetable mixture to skillet with cheese and chiles; stir gently to combine.
- Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup filling; roll up as tightly as possible. Arrange taquitos, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3 teaspoons oil.
- Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy, about 15 minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired, toppers.
