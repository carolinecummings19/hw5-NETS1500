Ingredients:
- 1 pound chestnuts

Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil; remove from heat.
- Wash and dry chestnuts. Place flat-side down on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, score a large "X" on rounded side, covering at least half of chestnut. Make sure the knife goes through outer skin and brown layer underneath. This will aid in peeling after roasting.
- Soak chestnuts in boiled water for 1 to 5 minutes, depending on size. Remove chestnuts with a slotted spoon and immediately transfer to the air fryer basket. Place 1 cup boiled water inside the basket.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 10 minutes. Shake well. Check to see if there is still water inside. If not, add another 1/2 cup. Continue cooking until shells have peeled away and exposed flesh has browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool until able to peel shells completely.
