Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
- ¾ cup thinly sliced green onion
- ½ cup sliced ginger
- 2 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¾ cup Shaoxing rice wine
- ½ cup dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 (1x4 inch) piece dried kombu (dried kelp)
- 1 ½ teaspoons date sugar (Optional)
- 3 quarts low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon goji berries
- ¼ cup sliced ginger

Directions:
- Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add fresh mushrooms, green onion, ginger, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add rice wine; cook, stirring and scraping browned bits from pan bottom, about 1 minute.
- Add dried mushrooms, dried kombu, date sugar, and vegetable broth. Simmer over medium-low heat until reduced by 3 cups, about 40 minutes. Strain and discard solids.
- Add goji berries and 1/4 cup sliced ginger to broth. Keep warm, covered, or chill, covered, up to 3 days. (Or freeze in an airtight container up to 3 months.)
- Serve broth tableside over a heat source to maintain a rigorous simmer. Cook desired ingredients in broth; serve with condiments.
