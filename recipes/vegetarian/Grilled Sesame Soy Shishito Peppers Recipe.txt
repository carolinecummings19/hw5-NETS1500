Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon finely grated ginger
- ½ teaspoon grated garlic
- 8 ounces shishito peppers, rinsed
- salt to taste

Directions:
- Whisk together sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl. Add shishito peppers and toss to combine. Let marinate for 15 to 20 minutes, tossing occasionally.
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and heat a grill pan on the grates.
- Remove peppers from marinade, letting excess marinade drip back into the bowl. Place peppers on the preheated grill pan and cook, tossing every 1 to 2 minutes, until evenly charred, 5 to 7 minutes.
- Return charred peppers to the bowl with marinade and toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and serve.
