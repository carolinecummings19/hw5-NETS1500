Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 (8-ounce) sliced fresh mozzarella cheese log
- 12 fresh basil leaves
- 6 grape or cherry tomatoes
- 3 large black olives
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, or to taste (optional)
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
- Pour balsamic vinegar into a small saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until vinegar has reduced to about 2 tablespoons and is thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and pour into a small container. Place into the fridge to cool and thicken more.
- Slice each grape or cherry tomato in half lengthwise. Cut a vertical slit down the center of each half to make the 'wings.' Slice each black olive into quarters.
- Place 12 slices of mozzarella on a serving platter, and pat dry with a paper towel. Top each with a basil leaf. Top the basil with one grape or cherry tomato half, then position an olive piece at the top of the tomato to form the head of the ladybug. Repeat with remaining tomatoes and olives.
- Remove balsamic reduction from fridge. Use a toothpick to dip into the reduction, and place dots of it all over the grape tomatoes to replicate ladybug markings. Repeat with each ladybug.
- Serve immediately with remaining balsamic reduction, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, and/or freshly ground black pepper.
