Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 (12 ounce) package frozen burger-style crumbles
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- 8 ounces spaghetti
- 1 cup kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (Optional)

Directions:
- Heat olive oil in a large frying pan. Sauté onion until tender. Mix in burger-style crumbles and garlic; cook until crumbles have browned.
- Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, vinegar, chili powder, brown sugar, cocoa, hot pepper sauce, cinnamon, paprika, and allspice. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until sauce thickens, 15 to 20 minutes.
- While the sauce is thickening, bring a large pot of salted water to boil; place spaghetti in the water and bring it to a boil again. Cook until al dente, about 12 minutes. Drain well.
- Stir beans into chili and mix lightly.
- Spoon cooked spaghetti into bowls and top with chili. Sprinkle with cheese.
