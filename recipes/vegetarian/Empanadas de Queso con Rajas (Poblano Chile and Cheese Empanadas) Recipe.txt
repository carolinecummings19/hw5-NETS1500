Ingredients:
- 1 large poblano pepper
- 1 cup grated Manchego cheese
- 2 tablespoons grated Manchego cheese
- 12 empanada pastry discs (such as GoyaÂ® Tapas para Empanadas)
- 1 egg, beaten

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Place poblano directly on the grates of a gas stove. Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally, until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 7 to 8 minutes. Peel off charred skins, remove seeds, and cut flesh into 1-inch squares.
- Place 1 1/2 tablespoons Manchego cheese onto each empanada disc. Top each with 1/2 tablespoon poblano peppers. Fold dough over on top of filling to close. Wet fingers with water and run them along the edges to help seal. Press edges together. Place empanadas on the prepared baking sheet and brush with beaten egg.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 24 to 26 minutes.
