Ingredients:
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup quinoa
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- ¼ cup minced yellow bell pepper
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
- Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.
- Roughly mash black beans with a fork, leaving some whole, to form a paste-like mixture. Mix quinoa, bread crumbs, bell pepper, egg, onion, garlic, cumin, hot pepper sauce, and salt into black beans using your hands. Form into 5 patties.
- Add olive oil to a large skillet and heat on medium.
- Cook patties until heated through and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Autumneyes
