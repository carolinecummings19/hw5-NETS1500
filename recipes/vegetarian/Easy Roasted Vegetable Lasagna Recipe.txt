Ingredients:
- olive oil cooking spray
- 2 zucchini, sliced
- 2 green bell peppers, cut in 1-inch pieces
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 onion, cut into 8 wedges
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 12 lasagna noodles
- 2 (28 ounce) jars pasta sauce
- 1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
- Arrange zucchini slices, bell pepper pieces, sliced mushrooms, and onion wedges on prepared baking sheet. Scatter basil and garlic over vegetables; coat with cooking spray. Season with salt and black pepper.
- Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are lightly browned and tender, 10 to 25 minutes.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
- Heat pasta sauce in a saucepan over medium-high heat to a simmer. Combine mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses in a bowl.
- Pour 1/3 cup pasta sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over sauce to cover. Spread 1/4 roasted vegetables over noodles, top with 1/4 sauce, sprinkle 1/4 cheese mixture over sauce. Repeat layers 3 more times, ending with cheese mixture.
- Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow lasagna to rest 10 minutes before slicing.
