Ingredients:
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- Â½ cup vegetable broth
- 1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 (28 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
- 2 (14 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 (14 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 canned chipotle chile in adobo sauce, seeded and finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
- Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Add oil; add onion and saute, stirring occasionally until tender and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute. Mix in chili powder, oregano, cumin, and garlic powder. Stir in tomato paste and saute the mixture for about 1 minute. Pour in broth and tomato sauce and with a wooden spoon scrape any browned bits from the base of the pot. This will prevent a burn notice. Mix in diced tomatoes, black beans, pinto beans, chipotle pepper, and salt (start with 1 teaspoon and adjust to taste after cooking).
- Cancel Saute function. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
- Stir chili and taste; adjust seasonings to your personal preference.
