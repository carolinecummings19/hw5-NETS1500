- Warm 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and garlic-flavored olive oil together in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in onions and mushrooms; reduce heat to low, and cook until the mixture has softened and caramelized, with browning around the edges, 8 to 12 minutes, adding additional olive oil if needed to prevent sticking.

- Turn off heat, drizzle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with Parmesan and Asiago cheeses. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
