Ingredients:
- 5 slices bacon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 cup portobello mushrooms, stem and ribs removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup chopped fresh asparagus
- 1 (8 inch) unbaked pie shell
- 1 large egg white, lightly beaten (Optional)
- 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup half-and-half cream
- ½ teaspoon salt
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels, crumble, and set aside.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent. Reduce heat to medium and add portobello mushrooms. Continue cooking until mushrooms are tender. Remove the skillet from heat and set aside.
- Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook asparagus in boiling water until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain and run under cold water to cool. Set aside.
- Brush pie shell with beaten egg white. Place onion-mushroom mixture, asparagus, and crumbled bacon into the bottom of pie shell. Sprinkle with Cheddar and feta cheese.
- Whisk together eggs, cream, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Pour over vegetable-cheese filling in pie shell.
- Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until filling is firm and the top is lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving.
