Ingredients:
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 (19 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 zucchini, chopped
- 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced
- 1 tablespoon minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup frozen corn
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
- Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.
- Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, chili powder, and cumin; cook and stir for 1 minute to release the flavors. Stir in black beans, tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, jalapeño pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Stir in quinoa and corn. Cook until corn is heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in cilantro, and serve.
