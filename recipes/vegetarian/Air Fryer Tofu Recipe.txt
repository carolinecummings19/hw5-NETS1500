Ingredients:
- 8 ounces firm tofu
- 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg®)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
- Place tofu onto a plate lined with several paper towels. Cover with more paper towels and another plate. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top and press tofu for 30 minutes; drain and discard any accumulated liquid and cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes.
- Combine soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, and sesame oil in a small bowl; mix well. Add tofu cubes and marinate for 15 to 20 minutes.
- Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
- Place tofu in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
- Air fry for 5 minutes without shaking the fryer. Continue air frying, shaking occasionally, until browned, about 10 more minutes.
