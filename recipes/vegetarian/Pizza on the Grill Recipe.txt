- Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.
- Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
