Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup fresh wood sorrel leaves, flowers and pods only
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (9 inch) pre-baked pie crust

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Heat butter over medium-low heat in a skillet. Cook and stir shallots and onion in butter until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt.
- Increase heat to medium. Pour white wine into the skillet and cook until evaporated. Stir in flour. Add sorrel and stir constantly for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool.
- While sorrel mixture is cooling, whisk together eggs, heavy cream, and black pepper in a large bowl.
- Combine sorrel mixture with egg mixture, 1/2 Gruyere cheese, and 1/2 Parmesan cheese. Pour mixture into the prepared pie crust. Top with remaining 1/2 Gruyere cheese and 1/2 Parmesan cheese.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean and tart is firm, about 1 hour.
