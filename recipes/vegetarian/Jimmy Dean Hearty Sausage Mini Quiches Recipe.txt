Ingredients:
- 1 (16 ounce) package Regular Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage, cooked, crumbled and drained
- 8 eggs, lightly beaten
- ¼ cup milk or water
- ¾ cup shredded Cheddar, mozzarella or provolone cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
- ½ cup thinly sliced green onion
- ½ cup diced sweet red pepper (Optional)
- 1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms or yellow squash (Optional)
- 1 cup frozen Southern-style hash brown potatoes or diced, pre-baked red potatoes (Optional)
- ¼ cup Parmesan cheese (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk or water, cheese, salt, and pepper; set aside. Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet; sauté onions and any optional vegetables desired until vegetables are tender. Add vegetables and sausage to egg mixture; stir well.
