Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 potato, sliced paper thin (peel optional)
- Â½ teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
- Lightly grease a large dinner plate with cooking spray; set aside.
- Pour oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add potato slices and shake to coat. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the prepared plate.
- Cook in the microwave on high until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove chips to a large bowl and toss with salt. Chips will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining potato slices; no need to grease the plate again.
