Ingredients:
- 1 cup rolled oats
- ½ cup pumpkin seeds
- ½ cup walnuts
- ½ cup pecans
- 15 pitted Medjool dates
- ½ cup brown rice syrup
- 1 cup mini chocolate chips
- ½ cup shredded coconut
- ½ cup raisins
- ¼ cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
- Burst oats into a coarse meal in the bowl of a food processor. Add pumpkin seeds, walnuts, and pecans; pulse 10 to 15 times, until chunks are desired size.
- Toss dates into the food processor and mix for 30 seconds. Pour rice syrup in slowly, with the processor running, until combined and starting to ball up.
- Transfer to a bowl and mix in chocolate chips, coconut, raisins, and sunflower seeds. Pull off dough in 25 gram sections and roll into balls. Place in a single layer on a cookie sheet; it's okay if they touch but make sure they are not stacked.
- Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours before serving.
