Ingredients:
- 1 cup diced carrots
- 1 cup peas
- ½ cup corn
- ½ cup diced celery
- 1 cube chicken-flavored vegetable bouillon
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
- ¼ teaspoon celery salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 ¾ cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth
- ⅔ cup almond milk
- 1 ½ cups diced chicken-style seitan
- 1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for 9-inch double crust pie

Directions:
- Combine carrots, peas, corn, celery, and bouillon cube in a saucepan. Add just enough water to cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook until veggies are fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour, remaining oil, celery salt, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir in broth and milk and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is thick, 5 to 8 minutes.
- Place bottom crust in a 9-inch pie plate. Place seitan and cooked veggies over the crust in an even layer. Pour sauce over top and cover with top crust. Seal edges and poke 4 or 5 large vent holes in the top crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and filling is bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes; check on the crust halfway through and if the edges are browning too quickly, cover with foil.
- Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
