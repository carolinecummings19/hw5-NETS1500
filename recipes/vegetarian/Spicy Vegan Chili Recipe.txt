Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 large green bell pepper, diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 jalapeno peppers, chopped (Optional)
- ¼ cup chili powder
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans
- 1 ½ cups water, or as needed
- 1 cup rinsed, uncooked white rice
- 1 (15 ounce) can corn
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®)

Directions:
- Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Sauté bell pepper, onion, and jalapeño peppers in hot oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add chili powder, garlic, salt, and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, making sure chili powder does not burn.
- Stir tomatoes, beans, water, and rice into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Check after 10 to 15 minutes if extra water is needed; add 1/4 cup at a time.
- Stir corn and black pepper into chili and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve with vegan cheese.
