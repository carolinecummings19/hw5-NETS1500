Ingredients:
- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces
- 10 slices bacon
- 2 (8-inch) unbaked pie shells
- 1 egg white, lightly beaten
- 2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
- 4 large eggs
- 1 ½ cups half-and-half cream
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Place asparagus in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water. Cover and cook until tender but still firm, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain and cool.
- Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble and set aside.
- Brush pie shells with beaten egg white. Sprinkle crumbled bacon and steamed asparagus into pie shells; sprinkle Swiss cheese over bacon and asparagus.
- Beat eggs, half-and-half, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well combined. Pour egg mixture on top of cheese.
- Bake quiches in the preheated oven until filling is set, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving. Allrecipes
