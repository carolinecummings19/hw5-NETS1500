Ingredients:
- 1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ¾ cup apple juice
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
- Inspect five 1/2-pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until pumpkin butter is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
- Stir pumpkin purée, sugar, apple juice, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large saucepan over medium heat until well combined; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
- Pack pumpkin butter into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
- Cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator.
