Ingredients:
- 1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust (such as Pillsbury)
- 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 5 Roma tomatoes, or more to taste, cut into wedges
- 1 cup loosely packed basil leaves, coarsely chopped (Optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup fat-free mayonnaise
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper
- 8 whole basil leaves (Optional)

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
- Press pie crust into a 9-inch round pan or glass pie plate; fold excess dough under and press to form a thick edge. Cover the edges with aluminum foil.
- Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese over the bottom. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Drain tomato wedges in a colander or on paper towels, then arrange over mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with basil and garlic.
- Combine remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan, and white pepper in a mixing bowl. Spread evenly over tomatoes; do not spread onto crust.
- Return to the oven and bake until the top is golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Cover the edges with a ring of foil to keep from overcooking if needed. Garnish the pie with whole basil leaves and serve warm.
