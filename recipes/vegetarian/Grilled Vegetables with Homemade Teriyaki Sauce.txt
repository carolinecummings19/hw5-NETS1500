- 2 cups fresh broccoli florets
- 10 baby carrots, halved lengthwise
- 4 button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 small zucchini, sliced into rounds
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ginger paste

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Preheat the side burner of the grill for medium heat.
- Place broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and zucchini in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over and toss to coat. Place vegetables into a grill basket.
