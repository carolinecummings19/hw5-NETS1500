Ingredients:
- 7 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked
- Â½ medium zucchini, thinly sliced with a vegetable peeler
- 10 sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
- 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan (or mozzarella) cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (Optional)
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Bring stock to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce heat to a low simmer.
- Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Add onion; cook until softened, 2 minutes.
- Add rice; cook until lightly toasted, 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually add simmering stock, stirring continuously. Risotto will become "creamy" and slightly sticky. When almost finished, stir in zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring continuously. When finished, the rice should be tender yet firm to the bite.
- Stir in 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and basil just before serving; divide among six bowls. Sprinkle servings with remaining 3 tablespoons cheese; season with black pepper.
