Ingredients:
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup finely diced onion
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash
- 4 large carrots, thinly sliced
- 12 cups vegetable broth
- 2 red potatoes, cubed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 cups finely chopped kale leaves
- 1 (16 ounce) can great Northern beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
- Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add butternut squash and carrots; cook and stir until squash begins to brown, about 15 minutes.
- Stir in broth, red potatoes, salt, pepper, and thyme; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in kale and great Northern beans; simmer until kale is tender, about 10 minutes.
- Add 3 cups soup to a blender, filled no more than halfway (you may have to do this in two batches). Cover and hold down lid with a folded kitchen towel, pulse a few times before leaving on to purée. Return puréed soup to Dutch oven, leave remaining soup chunky. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and partially purée soup in the Dutch oven.
