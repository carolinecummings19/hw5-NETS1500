Ingredients:
- 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- Â½ cup butter
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 1 large onion, minced
- 2 tablespoons dried summer savory
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 6 slices bread, cut into cubes
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two, then mash.
- Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook the celery and onion in the butter until the onion has turned translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Fold into the mashed potatoes along with the savory, and allow to cool until just warm.
- Place the cooled mashed potatoes into a large bowl, and stir in the beaten egg. Gently fold in cubed bread, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
