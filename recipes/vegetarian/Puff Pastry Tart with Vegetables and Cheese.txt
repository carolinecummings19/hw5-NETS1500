Ingredients:
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 cups chopped fresh mushrooms
- 1 cup chopped onion
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- ½ cup chopped fresh tomatoes, drained
- 1 (5.2 ounce) package garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12x18-inch sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.
- Place thawed puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out to a 10x14-inch rectangle and place on the prepared sheet. Score edges with a sharp knife, about 3/4 inch from the edge of the pastry, being careful not to cut all the way through the pastry. Inside the scored edges, prick several times with a fork. Brush pastry with beaten egg, reserving any unused.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Allow to cool slightly.
- Combine olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. When butter is melted, add chopped mushrooms and chopped onion. Cook until vegetables release their liquid, then continue cooking until the skillet is nearly dry, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Season onions and mushrooms with salt and pepper and stir in thawed and drained spinach and chopped tomatoes.
- Combine the remainder of the beaten egg, garlic and herb cheese spread, and cream in a small bowl. Gently brush cheese mixture over the partially baked puff pastry, staying inside the scored edges.
- Distribute the vegetable mixture over the cheese mixture and bake until the edges of the pastry are nicely browned and the cheese mixture is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan about 5 minutes.
- To serve, cut into serving pieces and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
