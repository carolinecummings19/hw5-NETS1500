Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup minced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 8 ounces plant-based hot Italian-style sausage (such as Beyond Meat), chopped
- 6 ounces cooked and crumbled ground meat substitute (such as Boca)
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ¾ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon fennel seeds
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 12 lasagna noodles
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced
- 6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese
- cooking spray

Directions:
- Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, tomato paste, water, 1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, basil, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat; simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Meanwhile, combine ricotta, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, egg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.
- Spread 1/3 tomato sauce mixture in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with 1/2 ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 tomato sauce mixture over mozzarella; sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers; top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. Coat a piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover baking dish, coated-side down.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool 15 minutes before slicing into 12 equal servings.
