Ingredients:
- 1 (12 ounce) package meatless ground beef substitute (such as Beyond Meat Beyond Beef Plant-Based Ground)
- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 Â½ teaspoons steak seasoning (such as McCormick)

Directions:
- Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Form ground beef substitute into three equal patties. Spray the top of each patty with nonstick spray and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon steak seasoning. Flip patties, place into the air fryer basket, then spray and season the other side.
- Cook in the preheated air fryer for 3 minutes. Flip and cook until done, about 3 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
