Ingredients:
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, minced
- 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
- 1 ½ cups diced cooked ham
- 1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup milk
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Place broccoli into a glass bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Cook in the microwave in 1-minute intervals until evenly heated through, about 5 minutes; drain and set aside.
- Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic in melted butter until onion is slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ham and broccoli into onion mixture, then transfer to pie crust.
- Beat together cheese, milk, eggs, and black pepper in a medium bowl; pour over ham mixture in crust. Sprinkle with paprika.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes.
