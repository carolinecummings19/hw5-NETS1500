Ingredients:
- 4 potatoes, peeled and quartered

- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
- In a large saucepan, bring potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, vegetable broth and salt to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potatoes are just tender. Do not rinse: mash mixture slightly. Stir in milk.

- Remove from heat: add cheese and stir until cheese is almost melted. Let soup stand for 5 minutes.
