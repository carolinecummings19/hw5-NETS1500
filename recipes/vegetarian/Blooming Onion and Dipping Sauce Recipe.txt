Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Make sauce: Mix mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup, paprika, cayenne, salt, oregano, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well combined. Cover and store in the refrigerator until needed. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Make coating: Beat milk and egg together in a medium bowl until well combined. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Spread "petals" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.) Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries. Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Drain on a rack or on paper towels. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
- Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
