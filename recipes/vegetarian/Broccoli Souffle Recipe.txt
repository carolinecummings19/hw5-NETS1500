Ingredients:
- 1 (14 ounce) bag frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
- ¼ cup margarine
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- ⅔ cup mayonnaise
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 3 tablespoons chopped onion
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes.
- Melt margarine in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour until combined. Slowly add milk, stirring to prevent lumps. Cook until sauce thickened, about 10 minutes.
- Combine broccoli, mayonnaise, eggs, and onion in a baking dish; stir in sauce to combine. Season with salt and black pepper.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top; continue baking until set, about 15 minutes more.
