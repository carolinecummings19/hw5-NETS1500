Ingredients:
- 1 (9 inch) pastry for single-crust pie
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ⅓ cup finely chopped red onion
- 1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
- ¾ cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- ⅓ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie pastry into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan; prick all over the bottom with a fork.
- Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool until needed.
- While the crust is cooling, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add onion and cook for 1 minute. Stir in spinach and cook until starting to wilt, about 1 minute. Cover and cook until condensation builds inside the skillet, about 1 minute. Remove the lid, stir to combine, and turn off the heat.
- Blend ricotta, cream, Parmigiano-Reggiano, eggs, basil, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor until smooth.
- Spread spinach mixture evenly over crust, then pour in ricotta and egg mixture.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the center is set and the top is lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
