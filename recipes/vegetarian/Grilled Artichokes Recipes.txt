Ingredients:
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 2 large artichokes
- ¾ cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients.
- Fill a large bowl with cold water. Squeeze juice from one lemon wedge into water. Trim tops and stems from artichokes, cut in half from top to bottom and scoop out the choke; place halves into the bowl of lemon water to prevent them from turning brown.
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add artichokes to boiling water, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
- To make the basting and dipping sauce: Squeeze remaining lemon wedges into a medium bowl; stir in olive oil and garlic, and season with salt and pepper.
- Brush artichokes with a coating of lemon-garlic dipping sauce; place on the preheated grill and cook, basting with sauce and turning frequently, until the tips are a little charred, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately with remaining lemon-garlic sauce.
