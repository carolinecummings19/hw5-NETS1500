Ingredients:
- 1 prepared 9-inch single pie crust
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 slice turkey bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
- Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic until green onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Cook and stir turkey bacon in green onion mixture until fragrant.
- Stir spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and broccoli into green onion mixture; cook and stir vegetables until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.
- Spoon vegetable mixture into pie crust.
- Beat eggs, milk, sea salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour egg mixture gently over vegetable filling, slightly stirring eggs into filling to combine.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; sprinkle 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over the top of quiche and bake 10 additional minutes. Cover quiche with aluminum foil and bake until quiche has set and a toothpick inserted into it comes out clean, about 10 more minutes.
