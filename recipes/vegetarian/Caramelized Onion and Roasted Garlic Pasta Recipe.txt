Ingredients:
- 2 heads garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 large white onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 8 ounces heavy cream
- 4 cloves roasted garlic, or to taste
- 1/4 cup chopped chopped parsley, divided
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- 8 ounces gemelli or other short pasta

Directions:
- To roast garlic: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place the garlic cloves in a shallow baking dish and cover with olive oil. Lay the sprigs of thyme on top of the oil.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Garlic should easily mash with a fork. Remove garlic from oil and set aside. Reserve oil for another use.
- To caramelize onions: Heat a roomy skillet over medium heat. Add butter and olive oil. Add onions to the pan and stir to coat. Stir frequently and move onions around, ensuring they cook evenly.
- Once onions have started to color a bit (about 15 minutes or so), add in water, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Continue to stir regularly until onions are completely soft, a golden brown color, and reduced by at least half, about 15 minutes more. Turn down the heat to medium low.
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add gemelli and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.. Meanwhile, add cream, 4 to 5 cloves roasted garlic, 1 tablespoon parsley, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to onions; stir to combine. Reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use.
- Drain pasta; divide among 4 plates. Spoon about a 1/4 cup of sauce on top; sprinkle with more Parmesan cheese, parsley, and black pepper.
