Ingredients:
- 4 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 cup orange juice
- ⅓ cup light brown sugar
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons grated orange zest
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced
- 1 teaspoon Crystallized Ginger (Dried) FSP
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup pecan halves
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons water
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- kosher salt to taste
- 1 sprig fresh mint

Directions:
- Place sweet potato chunks into a 4- or 5-quart slow cooker. Stir orange juice, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, orange zest, and ginger in a bowl. Pour over the sweet potatoes.
- Cover and cook on Low until sweet potatoes are very tender, 4 to 5 hours. Stir every hour. Cooking time will vary with the size of the chunks and the age of the sweet potatoes.
- Meanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Combine candied ginger, salt, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set spice mixture aside.
- Heat pecans in a nonstick pan until lightly toasted, stirring or shaking the pan constantly, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter and stir until melted. Mix in spice mixture and stir until pecans are coated. Sprinkle with brown sugar and water and mix to coat all the pecans. Cook until liquid evaporates, stirring constantly, about 2 more minutes.
- Spread out pecans on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and allow to cool.
- Use a hand mixer or potato masher to mash the sweet potatoes with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cream, and salt. Lightly chop the cooled pecans and sprinkle on top. Garnish with fresh mint.
