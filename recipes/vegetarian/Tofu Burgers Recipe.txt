Ingredients:
- 1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, frozen for 72 hours
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 large egg, beaten
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
- Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer. Leave frozen tofu in its package and place into the water. Remove from the heat and let tofu thaw for about 20 minutes in the hot water.
- Remove tofu from the package and transfer to a plate. Place another plate on top of tofu. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.
- While tofu is draining, heat 2 teaspoons oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery; sauté until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
- Finely chop tofu and place into a mixing bowl. Add onion and celery mixture, Cheddar, egg, salt, and pepper; mix until thoroughly combined.
- Pour 1/4 inch oil into a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Drop tofu mixture into the skillet in six equal portions. Flatten with a spatula to form patties. Fry until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
