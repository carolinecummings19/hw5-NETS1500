Ingredients:
- 1 ½ pounds cauliflower, broken into florets
- ¼ cup Buffalo wing sauce
- 1 teaspoon dry ranch dressing mix
- 1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
- Combine cauliflower, Buffalo sauce, ranch mix, and oil together in a large bowl.
- Fold an extra-long sheet of aluminum foil in half to make a double-layer sheet; place cauliflower mixture in the center. Pull two opposite edges of the foil over cauliflower, overlapping each other. Fold the remaining two edges in to create a packet. Don't seal the packet too tightly; leave some room for the steam to expand.
- Cook on the preheated grill until cauliflower is tender, about 15 minutes.
