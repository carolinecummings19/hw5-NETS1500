Ingredients:
- ⅓ cup dry chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
- ⅓ cup dry kidney beans
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon dried mint
- 2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 6 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 6 cups vegetable stock
- 3 bunches scallions, chopped (green parts only)
- 3 cups packed chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cups packed chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 cups packed chopped fresh mint
- ½ cup dry lentils
- ½ pound linguine pasta
- 1 pound fresh spinach, chopped
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
- 1 cup Greek yogurt

Directions:
- Place chickpeas and kidney beans into a large container; cover with several inches of cool water. Let stand 8 hours to overnight; drain.
- Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; continue cooking and stirring until onion is tender and golden brown, about 40 minutes more. Stir in dried mint; cook until onions become dark brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Set aside for garnish.
- Heat remaining olive oil in a stock pot; stir in yellow onions. Cook and stir until onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chickpeas, kidney beans, and turmeric; toss to combine. Stir in vegetable stock; simmer soup for 1 hour.
- Stir scallions, parsley, cilantro, mint, and lentils into soup; simmer 30 minutes more. Break linguine into 3 sections, stir into soup, and cook at a low boil until noodles are soft, 8 to 10 minutes.
- Stir 1/2 of the spinach into the soup until wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in remaining spinach and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Stir flour with 3 tablespoons of the soup liquid together in a small bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture back into soup. Continue to simmer soup over low heat, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
- Serve soup with yogurt and fried red onions.
