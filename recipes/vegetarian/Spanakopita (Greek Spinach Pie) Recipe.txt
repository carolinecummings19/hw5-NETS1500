Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 pounds spinach, rinsed and chopped
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 cup crumbled feta cheese
- ½ cup ricotta cheese
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 8 sheets phyllo dough
- ¼ cup olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
- Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9-inch square baking pan. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté chopped onion, green onions, and garlic in the hot oil until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Stir in spinach and parsley, adding spinach in batches if it doesn't all fit in the pan at once, and continue to saute until spinach is limp and excess liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans Recipe Tip To prevent a soggy spanakopita, allow the spinach mixture to cool and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible before moving on to the next step. You can place the spinach in a fine sieve or clean cloth and press or squeeze out excess liquid, working over the sink.
- Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in spinach mixture. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo dough; the sheets will overlap the pan. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans Expert Tip Our Editorial Director Diana Moutsopoulos likes to sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of semolina flour over the last layer of phyllo before adding the filling. The semolina helps to absorb excess moisture, preventing sogginess and keeping the phyllo cripsy. If you don't have semolina you can use Cream of Wheat.
- Spread spinach and cheese mixture into the pan. Fold any overhanging dough over the filling. Brush with oil. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Layer the remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil. Tuck overhanging dough into the pan to seal the filling. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Cut into squares and serve while hot. Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
- Enjoy! Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans
