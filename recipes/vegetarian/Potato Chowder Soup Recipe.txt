Ingredients:
- 2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
- ½ cup diced carrots
- ½ cup diced celery
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 cups water, or as needed to cover
- 2 cups milk
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 (15 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
- 2 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
- Place potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and salt into a large pot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes; do not drain.
- When the vegetables are almost finished, combine milk, butter, and flour in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until butter melts and mixture is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Pour hot milk mixture into cooked vegetables. Add corn and Cheddar; cook and stir until Cheddar melts, about 3 minutes. Danielle Stadelman RDN
