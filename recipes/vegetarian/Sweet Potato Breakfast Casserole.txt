Ingredients:
- 1 (8 ounce) package vegetarian sausage links (such as Morningstar Farms®)
- ½ cup water, more as needed
- 4 cups shredded sweet potatoes
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 8 jumbo eggs
- 1 (16 ounce) container low-fat small curd cottage cheese
- 1 ½ (8 ounce) packages shredded, reduced-fat mild Cheddar-mozzarella cheese blend
- 1 cup finely sliced fresh spinach
- ½ cup finely chopped onion

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
- Place sausage in a large skillet, add 1/4 inch of water, and cook over medium heat until water evaporates and sausages are evenly brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble sausages and set aside.
- Mix sweet potatoes and butter together in a bowl. Spread evenly on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
- Whisk eggs together in a large bowl. Fold in cottage cheese, Cheddar-mozzarella cheese, spinach, onion, and reserved sausages. Spoon over sweet potatoes.
- Bake casserole in the preheated oven until eggs are set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
