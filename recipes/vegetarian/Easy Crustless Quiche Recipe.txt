Ingredients:
- 1 pound bacon, chopped
- 1 pound pork sausage
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
- 8 large eggs
- 3 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Cook chopped bacon and sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often, until evenly browned and the bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
- Brush butter on the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese into bottom of the dish; top with bacon and sausage. Spread Cheddar cheese over bacon and sausage.
- Beat eggs, cream, and half-and-half together in a bowl; slowly pour over cheese and sausage.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool briefly before slicing and serving.
