Ingredients:
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped, divided
- 1 medium poblano pepper, chopped, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped, divided
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed
- 2 medium tomatoes, cut into chunks, divided
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 pinch ground chipotle seasoning
- salt to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package Impossible Burger
- 2 teaspoons adobo all-purpose seasoning
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 6 large bell peppers

Directions:
- Combine water and rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium pot. Add 1/2 of the onion, 1/2 of the poblano, and 1/2 of the garlic; sauté for 3 minutes. Stir in black beans and 1/2 of the tomatoes. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir cooked rice into black bean mixture. Season with cumin, chipotle, and salt. Set aside.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet. Add remaining onion, poblano, and garlic; sauté for 3 minutes. Add Impossible Burger; be sure to crumble well. Season with adobo and salt. Cook and stir until no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes. Add black bean-rice mixture, spinach, and remaining tomatoes to the skillet. Mix well and simmer for 3 minutes.
- Cut tops off bell peppers and remove cores. Use a spoon to stuff each pepper with filling. Arrange in a baking dish.
- Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
