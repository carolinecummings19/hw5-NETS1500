Ingredients:
- cooking spray
- ½ butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 3 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, or more to taste
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ large sweet onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- ¾ cup water
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 vegan pie crust

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
- Place squash and potatoes on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Set aside.
- Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Add flour; mix thoroughly. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until a thick paste is formed, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Pour broth into the onion-flour mixture. Whisk vigorously until mixture begins to thicken and comes to a boil, about 7 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme. Pour in water; reduce heat to a simmer. Add the baked squash and potatoes; cook over medium heat until fork-tender, about 10 minutes.
- Add frozen vegetables to the broth mixture. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour mixture into a large baking dish. Roll out the pie dough to fit the baking dish and lay it on top; make a few cuts in the dough to allow steam to escape.
- Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and crust is browned, about 30 minutes.
