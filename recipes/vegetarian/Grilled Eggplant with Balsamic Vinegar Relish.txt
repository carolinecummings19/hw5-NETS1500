Ingredients:
- 1 medium eggplant, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch-long strips
- 2 ¼ teaspoons salt, divided
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup diced tomato

Directions:
- Place sliced eggplant in a colander in the sink. Sprinkle eggplant with 2 teaspoons salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to release any bitter juices. Rinse with cold water and dry on paper towels.
- Heat a grill pan to high heat. Place 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl. Brush eggplant lightly with olive oil and grill for 2 minutes, pressing down occasionally with a spatula. Turn each slice, without flipping, and continue grilling for 2 more minutes to form beautiful grill marks. Flip eggplant and repeat this process on the other side. Remove grilled eggplant to a serving platter.
- Whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Add tomato and mix well. Pour over the grilled eggplant.
