Ingredients:
- 9 lasagna noodles
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ½ cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (16 ounce) can refried black beans
- 2 ¾ cups canned tomato sauce
- ½ cup salsa
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 ½ cups cottage cheese
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
- ¼ cup sliced ripe olives
- 8 sprigs fresh cilantro

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
- Coat a large skillet with non-stick cooking spray, and place over medium heat. Saute onion, red bell pepper, corn and garlic until tender. Stir in black beans, refried beans, tomato sauce, salsa and 1/4 cup cilantro. Cook until heated through and slightly thickened; set aside.
- In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese, ricotta, sour cream, shredded Monterey Jack cheese and remaining 1/4 cup chopped cilantro; set aside.
- Coat a 9x13 inch casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray. Arrange 3 of the cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the dish, cutting to fit if necessary. Spread with 1/3 of the bean mixture, then 1/3 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more.
- Cover, and bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Garnish with sliced black olives and sprigs of cilantro.
