Ingredients:
- 1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup canned coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 serrano pepper, seeded (if desired) and minced
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
- 4 teaspoons curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- oil for grill
- cilantro chutney or desired-flavor chutney, for serving

Directions:
- Cut tofu lengthwise into 8 (1/2-inch thick) rectangles. Wrap between several layers of paper towels and weight down with a heavy pan for about 30 minutes to remove excess liquid.
- Set a large resealable bag in a shallow dish. Whisk together yogurt, coconut milk, oil, serrano pepper, honey, garlic, ginger, curry powder, and salt in a small bowl. Add tofu and yogurt marinade to bag. Seal bag and turn to coat all tofu pieces with marinade. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
- Preheat an outdoor grill to low heat (225 degrees F to 250 degrees F / 107 degrees C to 120 degrees C). Generously oil grill grates four times. (Well greased grill grates are essential for this recipe.)
- Remove tofu from marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Reserve marinade for brushing. Thread tofu lengthwise on skewers.
- Grill kebabs, covered, turning halfway through, for 20 minutes, generously brushing with the reserved marinade in the last 3 minutes of grilling time. Serve kebabs with chutney for dipping. Cookâ€™s Note If you are using wooden skewers, soak for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.
