Ingredients:
- 6 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup milk, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup shredded American cheese
- pastry for a 9-inch double crust pie
- 2 teaspoons butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
- Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes. Mash the potatoes with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, salt, and black pepper to make medium-stiff mashed potatoes; stir in cheese.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Fit a crust into a 9-inch pie dish and fill with potato mixture. Place the top crust on pie, roll the edges together, and crimp with a fork to seal.
- Stir together 2 teaspoons melted butter and 2 teaspoons milk in a small bowl until well combined; brush over crust. Cut several vent holes in the top of crust.
- Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes; if the edges are getting too brown, wrap them in aluminum foil.
