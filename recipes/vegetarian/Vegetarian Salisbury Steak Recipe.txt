Ingredients:
- 1 large onion, halved
- 1 ½ (12 ounce) packages meatless ground beef substitute (such as Impossible™ Foods)
- ¼ cup bread crumbs
- 1 large egg (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder, divided
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 ¾ cups vegetable broth
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons vegetable broth

Directions:
- Slice one onion half and set aside. Mince the remaining onion half and place in a large mixing bowl.
- Add ground beef substitute, bread crumbs, egg, 1/2 of the garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the minced onion. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. Divide into 4 equal patties.
- Heat 1/2 of the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove patties to a plate.
- Add remaining olive oil, reserved onion slices, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.
- Add 1 3/4 cups vegetable broth, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining garlic powder; stir to combine and season with salt and pepper. Return patties to the pan, reduce heat, and simmer until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
- Remove patties and plate them. Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons vegetable broth into a slurry; add slurry to the skillet. Cook and stir until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle hot sauce over cooked patties.
