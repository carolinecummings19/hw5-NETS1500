Ingredients:
- 1 (8 ounce) package dry black beans
- 2 stalks celery, cut into thirds
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can water
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 3 dashes hot pepper sauce, or to taste

Directions:
- Rinse beans and remove any particles or bad beans. Place beans in a saucepan; cover with 2 inches water. Add celery and bay leaves.; bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, adding more water as necessary, for 10 minutes. Drain beans; discard celery.
- Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and carrot; sauté until onion fairly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, salt, cumin, and pepper flakes; cook until heated through and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker.
- Add tomatoes and water to slow cooker; stir in beans and bay leaves. Cover slow cooker.
- Cook on Low until beans are tender enough that you can easily smash one between your tongue and the top of your mouth for 6 hours (or on High for 4 hours). Add vinegar. Taste and adjust seasonings; add hot pepper sauce.
