Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups shredded Swiss cheese
- 4 teaspoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust, frozen
- ½ cup cooked ham, diced
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground dry mustard
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped pimento peppers

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)
- Toss shredded cheese and flour together in a medium bowl. Sprinkle mixture onto frozen pie crust. Add diced ham on top of cheese.
- Combine eggs, milk, salt, and dry mustard in a medium bowl. Beat until smooth and pour over cheese and ham.
- Place foil around the edges of the crust to protect it from burning.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour. A knife inserted into the center of the quiche should come out clean.
- Garnish with parsley and pimento peppers before serving. chibi chef
