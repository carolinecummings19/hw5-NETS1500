Ingredients:
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
- 1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- ½ cup red lentils
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 4 cups vegetable broth

Directions:
- Melt butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add sweet potatoes, carrots, apple, and onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.
- Stir in lentils, salt, ginger, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and paprika, then pour in broth. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lentils and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.
