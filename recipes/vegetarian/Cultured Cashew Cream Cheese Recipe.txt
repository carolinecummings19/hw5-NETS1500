Ingredients:
- 2 cups raw cashews
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 3 tablespoons plain cashewmilk yogurt
- 1/4 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
- Place cashews in a bowl with enough cold water to cover, and soak cashews overnight or up to 24 hours.
- Drain, and add nuts to a blender, along with sea salt, nutritional yeast, vinegar, cashew yogurt, and water. Blend on high until very smooth.
- Transfer into a sterilized glass container (See Note), and let ferment in a warm spot for 8 to 24 hours, or until the mixture is as tangy and fermented as you want.
- This can be done at room temperature, which will take longer, or wrapped in a heating pad set on low (about 90 degrees F (32 degrees C)), which will speed up the process.
- Check, stir, and taste mixture a few times during the process to monitor its progress.
- Once the mixture has fermented as long as you want, season with salt to taste. At this point, additional flavoring can be added such as garlic, herbs, or spices.
- Chill before serving, at least 1 hour. For best results, refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours to let the flavors develop even more. John Mitzewich From the Editor: To prevent rogue bacteria from taking over the fermentation process, use very clean tools. A dishwasher set to sanitize might be adequate for cleaning the spoon and blender you use, but the fermentation container and lid should be sterilized. Here are 3 easy methods for sterilizing: Fill a bowl with boiling water to the brim; immerse container and lid. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain and air dry. Wash and rinse container and lid; air dry. Place the container and lid in the oven at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Dilute 1 teaspoon bleach in 3 1/2 quarts water. Immerse and soak equipment for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with hot water. Air dry. Cover until ready to use to avoid recontamination.
