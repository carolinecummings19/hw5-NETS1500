Ingredients:
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese
- 1 pound firm tofu, crumbled
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 ½ pounds fresh spinach, washed and chopped
- 2 egg whites, beaten
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 8 lasagna noodles
- 6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 6 cups tomato sauce

Directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain. Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil, adding water as needed to keep from sticking.
- Combine the ricotta, tofu, Parmesan cheese, spinach, egg whites, black pepper, parsley, and sauteed onion and garlic. Mix well.
- Spray a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Arrange a layer of cooked noodles on the bottom. Top with 1/3 each of the ricotta mixture, the mozzarella and the tomato sauce. Repeat layers twice more, ending with tomato sauce. Cover with foil.
- Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake 10 to 15 more minutes.
