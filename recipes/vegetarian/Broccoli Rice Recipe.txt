Ingredients:
- 1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ small onion, minced
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
- Place 1/2 of the broccoli florets in a food processor; pulse about 20 times until broccoli looks like grains of rice. Repeat with remaining broccoli florets.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook for 30 seconds. Stir in broccoli rice, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until broccoli has softened, about 5 minutes. Pour lemon juice on top.
