Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 ½ cups almond milk
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup coconut oil, warmed until liquid
- 1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin pans or line with 18 paper baking cups.
- Pour apple cider vinegar into a 2-cup measuring cup. Fill with almond milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Let stand until curdled, about 5 minutes.
- Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together almond milk mixture, coconut oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon batter evenly into the prepared cups.
- Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack.
- Arrange cooled cupcakes on a serving platter. Frost with desired frosting. jcalliagas
