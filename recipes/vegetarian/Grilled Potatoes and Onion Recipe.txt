Ingredients:
- 4 potatoes, sliced
- 1 red onion, sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons butter

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
- Measure out 2 or 3 squares of aluminum foil large enough to easily wrap vegetables. For each packet, place some of the potatoes and onion in the center, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dot with butter. Wrap into a flattened square and seal the edges. Repeat with remaining potatoes and onion.
- Place aluminum-wrapped packages over indirect heat. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, turning once. Serve hot off the grill.
