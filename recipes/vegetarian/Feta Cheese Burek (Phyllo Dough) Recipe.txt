- 1 cup cottage cheese
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
- 2 eggs

- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup vegetable oil

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet lightly.
- Mix feta cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk milk and oil together in a small bowl.
- Brush milk-oil mixture over 3 sheets of phyllo dough and stack together. Place some of the cheese mixture in a straight line on one end of the dough. Roll up tightly to form a spiral shape.
