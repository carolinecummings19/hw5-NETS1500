Ingredients:
- 2 (14 ounce) packages extra-firm tofu, drained
- ½ cup sherry vinegar
- ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon dried marjoram or thyme (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients.
- Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.
- Meanwhile, mix vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, cayenne, marjoram, and black pepper together in a small bowl.
- Cut each piece of tofu crosswise into 6 thick slices; place in a baking dish. Pour marinade over tofu, turning to coat, and chill, covered, turning occasionally, for at least 30 minutes or up to 48 hours. Longer is better, but shorter is totally fine.
- Preheat an outdoor grill or charcoal grill for high heat. Reduce heat to medium and lightly oil the grate.
- Remove tofu slices from marinade and shake off excess; reserve remaining marinade to make the sauce.
- Cook tofu on preheated grill, turning once, until well browned but before grill marks get black, 10 to 15 minutes total. Transfer tofu to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.
- Bring reserved marinade to a boil in a saucepan; simmer until it reduces to about 1 cup, about 2 minutes. Pour over tofu and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
