Ingredients:
- 1 pound fusilli corti bucati pasta
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 2 lemons, zested and juiced
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 cups baby spinach
- small handful basil leaves, cut into very thin strips, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, or to taste
- lemon slices

Directions:
- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fusilli and return to a boil; cook until pasta is tender with a bite, 8 to 12 minutes. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain. Return pasta to the pot.
- In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Season with Italian seasoning, garlic granules, salt, black pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.
- Add ricotta mixture and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to pasta and toss. The sauce will thicken and adhere as it is tossed. Add more reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.
- Place spinach in a colander. Pour remaining reserved pasta water over spinach to wilt; toss spinach into pasta.
- Divide into serving bowls. Top each serving with a slice of lemon, basil, thyme, cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.
