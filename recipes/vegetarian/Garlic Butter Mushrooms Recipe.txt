Ingredients:
- 1 pound fresh white mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel and gently remove and discard stems.
- Drizzle oil into a large cast iron skillet to evenly coat. Place mushrooms into the skillet, cap-side down. Carefully sprinkle garlic into the mushroom cavities, taking care not to sprinkle directly into the skillet. Drizzle mushrooms with melted butter, then season with salt and pepper.
- Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and return to the oven for 3 to 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. Let cool slightly before serving.
