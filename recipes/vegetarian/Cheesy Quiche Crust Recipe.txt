Ingredients:
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 5 teaspoons cold water

Directions:
- Place flour in a large bowl. Sprinkle in butter; rub butter into flour until it resembles bread crumbs. Stir in cheese. Sprinkle cold water over flour mixture, a teaspoon at a time, stirring lightly with a fork. Add just enough water to allow dough to form a ball and cleanly leave the sides of the bowl. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- Roll out dough and place in a 9-inch pie or quiche pan. Use a fork to prick holes over the bottom of pastry.
- Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes before filling with quiche filling of your choice.
