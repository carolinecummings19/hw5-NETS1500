Ingredients:
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 head garlic
- ½ teaspoon olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese
- ½ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- 2 blood oranges
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
- chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- Put cauliflower on a foil-lined 10x15-inch baking pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.
- Peel away dry outer layers of garlic bulb, leaving inner layers and cloves intact. Trim bulb top to expose cloves; set, cut side up, in a custard cup or ramekin. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon oil. Cover with foil.
- Roast cauliflower and garlic, turning cauliflower once, until cauliflower is deeply browned and tender, and garlic cloves are soft, about 25 minutes. Let garlic cool slightly, then squeeze cloves into a small bowl and mash with a fork.
- Process 1 teaspoon of the mashed roasted garlic in a food processor with feta, yogurt, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil until smooth. (Reserve remaining garlic for another use.)
- Remove 1 teaspoon zest from one blood orange, then cut both oranges into suprêmes. (Trim away peel and all white pith from fruit, then cut inner membranes away from individual segments).
- Spread whipped feta onto a large platter. Top with roasted cauliflower, orange suprêmes, pine nuts, zest, and parsley.
