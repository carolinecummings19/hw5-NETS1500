Ingredients:
- 5 ounces fresh spinach
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- ½ yellow onion, sliced
- 2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
- 4 ounces shredded Swiss cheese, divided
- 1 9-inch deep dish prepared pie crust
- 4 large eggs
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
- Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
- Gently combine spinach, mushrooms, onion, and feta cheese in a bowl. Spread mixture into prepared pie crust; top with 1/2 of the Swiss cheese.
- Whisk eggs, milk, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg in the bowl. Pour egg mixture evenly over filling, swirling egg mixture in bowl to evenly distribute seasonings. Top with remaining Swiss cheese, then place quiche on a baking sheet.
