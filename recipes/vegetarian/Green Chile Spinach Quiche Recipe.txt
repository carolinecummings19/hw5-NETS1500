Ingredients:
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 12 eggs
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 cups small curd cottage cheese
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, and drained
- 2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles
- ½ cup melted butter
- 2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.
- Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth. Whisk in flour mixture until no lumps remain. Stir in the Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, cottage cheese, spinach, green chiles, and melted butter until evenly blended. Divide mixture between pie crusts.
- Bake quiches in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until quiches are lightly browned, and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
