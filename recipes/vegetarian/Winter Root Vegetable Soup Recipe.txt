Ingredients:
- 3 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 turnips, quartered
- 1 (2 pound) butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 celery root, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- ½ sweet onion, diced
- 1 quart vegetable broth, or more as needed
- ½ cup half-and-half
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
- Combine parsnips, carrots, turnips, butternut squash, celery root, and sweet potato in a large roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil; season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Toss vegetables to evenly distribute seasonings.
- Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.
- Meanwhile, melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in diced celery and onion; cook and stir until onion softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth; bring to a simmer, uncovered. Stir in roasted vegetables; continue simmering for 10 minutes. Purée soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir in half-and-half; season with salt and black pepper. Add more vegetable broth if too thick.
