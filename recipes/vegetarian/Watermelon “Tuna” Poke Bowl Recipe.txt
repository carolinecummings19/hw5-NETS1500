Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup less-sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon lime zest
- 3 tablespoons lime juice (from 2 limes)
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 lb watermelon, rind removed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup Japanese-style mayonnaise (such as KewpieÂ®)
- 4 cups hot cooked short-grain white rice
- 2 avocados, sliced
- 1 English cucumber, sliced
- 1 cup sliced radishes
- 1 cup hot cooked shelled edamame
- 1 carrot, shredded
- 1 tablespoons black and/or white sesame seeds
- thinly sliced green onions, for garnish

Directions:
- For marinade, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, oil, lime zest, lime juice, ginger, and honey in a large bowl. Add watermelon; toss to coat. Chill, covered, at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
- Transfer watermelon from marinade to prepared pan with a slotted spoon, allowing marinade to drip off. Chill remaining marinade, covered, while watermelon bakes. Bake watermelon until browned, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly.
- For dressing, stir 2 tablespoons reserved marinade into mayonnaise in a small bowl. Pour remaining reserved marinade over baked watermelon.
- Divide rice among 4 bowls. Top each serving with watermelon, avocados, cucumber, radishes, edamame, and carrot. Drizzle with dressing and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Garnish with green onions. Vegan-ize Use vegan mayonnaise instead of rich, tangy-sweet Kewpie.
