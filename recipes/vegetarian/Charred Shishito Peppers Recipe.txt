Ingredients:
- 8 ounces shishito peppers
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- Â½ lemon
- coarse sea salt to taste

Directions:
- Rinse shishito peppers, then dry thoroughly so no moisture remains. Use a sharp knife to randomly poke peppers to prevent steam from building up when charring. Toss peppers with oil in a large bowl.
- Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place peppers in the skillet in a single layer, working in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding.
- Cook for 2 minutes without moving the peppers. Peppers may sizzle and pop. Turn peppers over and cook for 2 minutes more. Turn heat off and squeeze lemon over the peppers, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt.
