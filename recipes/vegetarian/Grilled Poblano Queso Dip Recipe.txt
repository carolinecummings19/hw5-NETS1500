Ingredients:
- 3 poblano peppers
- extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- milk
- 1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 grinds fresh cracked black pepper
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 (16 ounce) package corn chips

Directions:
- Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, 400 degrees F or 200 degrees C, and lightly oil the grate.
- Lightly spray or brush poblano peppers with olive oil. Cook peppers on the preheated grill, turning every couple minutes, until charred and softened, 5 to 8 minutes.
- Remove peppers from the grill and place in a large resealable plastic bag to steam, about 15 minutes. Peel off charred skins. Discard seeds and chop peppers.
- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook for 1 minute more. Whisk in milk slowly and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add Monterey Jack cheese, cream cheese, salt, paprika, pepper, red pepper flakes, and cayenne; whisk until cheeses have melted and are blended in, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped poblano peppers.
