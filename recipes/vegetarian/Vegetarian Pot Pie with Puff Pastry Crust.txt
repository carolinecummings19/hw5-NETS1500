Ingredients:
- extra-virgin olive oil cooking spray
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 cup chopped mushrooms
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning blend
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon rubbed sage
- ½ teaspoon ground sweet paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 cup chopped fresh spinach
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can vegetable broth
- 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart souffle or other baking dish with cooking spray.
- Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until bubbly. Add onion and cook until it begins to turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften and release a little moisture, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Stir in Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, sage, paprika, and cayenne. Stir in spinach and parsley; cook until spinach is just wilted, about 1 minutes. Add flour and stir until flour is coated in butter and seasonings; continue to cook and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in frozen vegetables and vegetable broth; bring to a boil. Cook until mixture begins to thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in nutritional yeast.
- Pour mixture into the prepared dish. Place puff pastry sheet over top, allowing it to drape over the sides of the dish. Use a fork to poke several holes in the top of the pastry, then spray with cooking spray. Place the baking dish on a sheet pan.
- Transfer to the preheated oven and bake until the top is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before serving.
